<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a collapsible garment and a method for using the same. More particularly, the invention relates to a swimsuit that can be folded into its belt or a pouch attached to the belt without the necessity of taking the garment off and a method for manufacturing such a swimsuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the &ldquo;back to nature&rdquo; movement and in enjoying life unencumbered by clothes. Most jurisdictions have regulations against public nudity and this acts as a restraint on those who would like to enjoy life in pretty much the state in which they were born. People will be people and those who would like to swim &ldquo;in the raw&rdquo;, so to speak, have two choices if they wish to act unfettered: (a) wear no clothing, or, (b) wear a swimsuit on the beach and take it all off when at a safe distance from any Peeping Toms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As noted above, option (a) is usually illegal and, in many instances, people are not disposed to so appear in public. There is also the problem of finding a deserted location at which to take off the swimsuit. Facilities for discrete donning and removal of clothing may not exist at beaches and swimming pools. Removing clothing also presents problems in cold and/or windy weather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Option (b), while aesthetically more appealing to the public at large, presents dangers to the swimmer. Taking the swimsuit off under water requires either bending down or stepping out of the swimsuit and can be dangerous and has the problem of collecting sand and grit inside the swimsuit. There is the additional problem of holding on to the garment once it has been taken off: if both hands are not devoted to the task, there is the risk of losing the swimsuit and the swimmer is back to the situation presented in option (a). Prior art swimsuits also present problems in putting the swimsuit back on. There is difficulty in identifying the proper holes into which legs must go, particularly in active surf. Once back on, any accumulated sand and grit can be very uncomfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,920 to Holland, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, teaches a swimsuit that includes a body and a belt, a portion of the body encircling a portion of the belt to form at least one pouch. The other end of the body has fastening devices that attach them to the belt opposite the pouch to form a conventional-looking swimsuit. Detaching the clips, folding up the body and inserting it into the pouch(es) gives a compact arrangement of a belt with a small pouch attached to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention of Holland is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art). As shown, the swimsuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adapted to encircle a human waist. The belt defines an inside and an outside. The belt is preferably made of a fabric with some ability to stretch so as to maintain a snug fit with the waist of the person wearing the garment. The swimsuit also includes a body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, one end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which defines a pair of pouches (storage compartments) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that enclose a portion of the belt. The sides of pouches are maintained in sliding contact with the portion of the belt that they encircle and are provided with openings purpose of which will be discussed below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pouches are separated by a seam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the middle, the seam coupling the body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An alternated embodiment of the invention has a single pouch extending all the way across the back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention of Holland, while being fully adapted for the function for which it was designed, was found to have some drawbacks. Drawbacks are purely aesthetic. When the swimsuit is fully folded into the pouch surrounding the belt may, it may have a bulky appearance. In addition, when the swimsuit is in the configuration for wear on the beach, it may be difficult to configure the top rear of the suit for a perfect fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a swimsuit that enables the law abiding swimmer to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Such a swimsuit should allow the swimmer to enter the water discretely clothed. Such a swimsuit should preferably be safe and easy to disengage from the human body. Such a swimsuit should remain attached to the human body without the use of hands. Such a swimsuit should be easy to put back on. In addition, it should preferably be aesthetically appealing in both the engaged and disengaged positions. The swimsuit should also be easy to manufacture. The present invention satisfies this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is a modification of a conventional swimsuit that has a pair of detachable fasteners. When the fasteners are decoupled, the portion of the swimsuit encircling human legs is &ldquo;opened up&rdquo; and may be rolled into a compact size that can be stowed inside a pouch on the swimsuit. Support for the swimsuit is provided by a loop that at least partially encircles a human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a method of using the novel swimsuit so as to appear covered up in the closed configuration of the swimsuit and to be able to open up the swimsuit while the swimsuit is supported by a loop around the human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a novel collapsible swimsuit by attaching a loop and a plurality of fastening devices to a prior art swimsuit that has been altered.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is best understood with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that illustrate the arrangement of the various parts of the swimsuit. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is shown. The swimsuit includes a loop <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> attached to the swimsuit to at least partially enclose a human waist: the exact manner in which it encircles the human waist is discussed below. The loop may be made of any suitable material but in a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> preferably comprises a decorative chain that is made of material resistant to corrosion by seawater. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop comprises a tubular member such as a cord or &ldquo;piping&rdquo;. Two fasteners <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are shown in the engaged position so that the swimsuit appears at first sight to be a conventional swimsuit with a decorative loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the swimsuit is shown in the disengaged configuration with the fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>now showing its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; disengaged into its components and fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disengaged into its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, another feature of the swimsuit becomes apparent: the rear of the swimsuit is seen to have an additional piece of fabric <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (with a seam <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) that defines a pouch between the member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the rear of the swimsuit. The pouch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has two openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the loop member is preferably inserted into the pouch (storage compartment). In one embodiment of the invention, the loop member may pass completely through the pouch and thus be capable of fully encircling the human waist. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop member may be fastened at two places (not shown) to the rear of the swimsuit and thus only partially encircle the human waist. Other configurations of the swimsuit may include two pouches as taught in Holland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As taught in Holland, the body of the swimsuit may be rolled up and inserted for storage into the pouch or storage compartment. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a method of making the swimsuit discussed above is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a conventional swimsuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By separating the swimsuit, e.g. by cutting, at locations indicated by <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> results. Manufacture of the swimsuit of the present invention then requires the addition of a piece of fabric <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to the swimsuit by a seam such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to define a storage compartment with ends <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> shown, the addition of fastening devices at or near the locations of the separation points <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the incorporation of the loop <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to give a result that would appear to be substantially the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The advantages of this method of making the swimsuit would be clear since this modification could be done to &ldquo;off the rack&rdquo; items that are widely available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the invention. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention </paragraph>

The garment is primarily intended for maintaining one or both of the user&apos;s arms close against the body to facilitate relaxation while in cramped or tight positions, such as in an airplane seat. However, the garment may also be used in a wide variety of applications wherein it is desired to support one or both of the user&apos;s arms in a releasably fixed position. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a garment, and more specifically to a garment adapted for assisting a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various devices have been proposed for wear on a body to assist a person in maintaining his or her arms or legs in a desired position. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,137 to Bustance describes an athletic training device adapted to be worn by a boxer to help maintain the boxer&apos;s arms in the desired &ldquo;ready&rdquo; position during training exercises. The device in Bustance includes a vest element worn around the torso and a pair of sleeve elements worn around the bicep region of each arm. The vest and sleeve elements each include attachment means for releasably attaching the sleeves to the vest. This device improves the boxer&apos;s form by training him to hold his upper arms tightly against the sides of his torso while in the defensive position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,747,779 to Gerstung describes a form-keeping device for training gymnasts or spring-board divers to hold their legs and feet together during a gymnastic exercise or a dive. The device in Gerstung comprises a pair of straps adapted to be worn around the ankles and a pair of spacing elements configured to maintain the ankles at a fixed distance apart. Each of the ankle straps includes a portion having a loop or hook material for releasably attaching the two straps together during use to keep the ankles together during the desired routine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In yet another example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,334 to Proffer describes a harness adapted for wear by the front rider of a tandem pair on a motorcycle. The harness is provided with a number of handholds for enabling the rear rider to hold on to the front rider. The handholds are positioned on the garment such that the rear rider can comfortably maintain his or her arms around the waist of the front rider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although various garment-type devices have been proposed for assisting persons to maintain their arms or legs in desired positions during physical activities, none of the proposed devices provides a means for assisting persons to releasably secure their hands to a desired location along their upper body. Such a device is very desirable for a number of reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For example, larger individuals are often quite uncomfortable during travel, such as by airplane, bus or train, because seats on these vehicles are typically not well-suited for larger body sizes and cannot be adjusted in width. As a result, the arms of larger individuals tend to extend over the armrest and thereby contact adjacent passengers. Worse yet, an individual&apos;s arm may extend into an aisle where it can be hit and injured by passersby or food carts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To avoid contacting other passengers and objects, some individuals have found it helpful to cross their arms and lay their hands flatly against their chest with their palms facing their torso. This position effectively narrows the individual&apos;s body width and thereby helps to prevent the problems just described. However, this position is difficult or impossible to maintain for extended periods due to the resulting muscle strain on the individual&apos;s shoulders and arms. The muscle strain and the associated discomfort can make it difficult or impossible for the passenger to relax or sleep during travel. Moreover, it has been found that prolonged muscle strain can lead to long-term health problems, such as, for example, tendinitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along his or her upper body is after an injury. Following an injury to an arm or shoulder, a sling is typically used to immobilize the arm. However, in many situations, a conventional sling may be uncomfortable, cumbersome or impractical. Furthermore, during the latter stages of the healing process, it may be desirable to use an injured arm for limited purposes; however, it can be very cumbersome to take off and put on a sling each time the person wishes to use his or her arm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is during transportation of a victim via a stretcher or similar means. Many stretchers do not include a strap or belt for securing the victim onto the stretcher. Other times, a victim is unable or unwilling to accept being secured to a stretcher via a strap. When no strap is used, it is difficult to prevent the victim&apos;s arms from falling over the sides of the stretcher, particularly if the victim is particularly large or the stretcher is narrow. If one or both of the victim&apos;s arms fall over the sides of the stretcher it can seriously aggravate an existing injury or result in an additional injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another situation where it would be desirable for a person to maintain one or both hands along the upper body is for minimizing the effects of certain neurological disorders. Some types of neurological disorders may be outwardly manifested by conditions such as body tremors or involuntary muscular movements. At times, such as in certain social situations or for safety concerns, it would be desirable to provide a device to help stabilize the person&apos;s hands and/or arms to prevent involuntary movements of the hands and/or arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Thus, for at least these reasons, there remains a very real and substantial need for a new and improved garment that can be used to releasably secure a user&apos;s hands to the upper body in a desired position, such as in a folded configuration. Such a garment would be beneficial for the reasons described above and would be particularly useful for allowing larger individuals to travel in greater comfort. To be practical, it is desirable that such a garment be comfortable to wear. It is also desirable that such a garment has a minimum number of parts and utilizes simple attachment means for convenience and ease of use. It is also desirable that such a garment is constructed of durable materials that can be washed and reused. Finally, it is desirable that such a garment be inexpensive to manufacture, aesthetically appealing, and versatile enough for a wide range of applications. The present invention addresses these needs. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A primary object of the present invention is to provide a garment that enables a person to releasably secure one or both hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the garment comprises an upper portion, such as a vest or shirt, adapted for wear on the user&apos;s torso region. The upper portion has at least a region formed with a first attachment means. The garment also comprises a hand portion, such as a glove or strap, adapted for wear along at least one of the user&apos;s hands. The hand portion has a region formed with a second attachment means that is releasably engageable to the first attachment means for attaching the user&apos;s hands to his or her upper body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, a variety of attachment means can be used with the present invention including, but not limited to, loop and hook materials, buttons, hooks, snaps and clasps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment is in the form of a strap that can be worn around the user&apos;s neck. The first attachment means is preferably located along the ends of the strap. The strap may include a padded region along the portion of the strap that passes along the back of the user&apos;s neck. The padded region increases the user&apos;s comfort and can be used to support the user&apos;s head during rest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap or a chest strap having a section with the first attachment means disposed along the outer surface of the strap. The hand portion, such as a glove, is releasably engageable to the strap for immobilizing one or both hands or arms.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Larger individuals are often uncomfortable while seated on vehicles such as airplanes, buses or trains because their arms tend to extend over the armrests and contact adjacent passengers or passersby. As a result, many individuals have found it helpful to place their arms in a folded position across their chest. This position effectively narrows their body width and helps to avoid contact with others. Unfortunately, however, this position can be very difficult to maintain, particularly during longer trips. Therefore, a need exists for a garment system that provides users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms at selectable locations along their upper body. Such a device would help prevent muscle strain and thereby significantly increase the user&apos;s comfort during travel. Such a device would also be useful in a wide variety of other applications, such as for maintaining a user&apos;s hands or arms in a fixed position during rehabilitation after an injury or to help control body tremors resulting from neurological disorders. To be practical, the garment system must be reliable, convenient and easy to transport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To address these needs, the present invention provides a new and improved garment adapted for providing users with the ability to releasably secure their hands or arms along their upper body. Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, for purposes of illustration, a preferred embodiment of the present invention provides a garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including, generally, an upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a pair of hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is worn over the torso and can take a variety of different forms, such as, for example, a shirt, a vest or a sweater. The upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a material that provides a first attachment means, such as, for example, a loop material. Alternatively, patches of material can be sewn or otherwise attached to the upper portion of the garment to provide first attachment means in specific locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a pair of gloves with open fingers for comfort and convenience. However, it will be appreciated that the hand portions may take a variety of different forms. Furthermore, the hand portions may be worn on the wrists or forearms and therefore the term &ldquo;hand portions&rdquo; should not be construed as limited to articles adapted for wear only on the hands. The hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include at least a region of material, such as, for example, a hook material, that provides a second attachment means. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm. The second attachment means releasably adheres to the first attachment means for providing the user with the ability to affix at least one hand to his or her upper body at a selectable location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> during use wherein the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a comfortable and convenient means for maintaining the user&apos;s hands in a fixed position along his or her upper body. As discussed above, this garment is particularly well suited for larger people while traveling on vehicles, such as on airplanes, buses, or trains, wherein the seats are often too narrow for their body size. By enabling the user to easily maintain his or her arms in a desired position along his or her upper body, the user&apos;s arms are prevented from contacting adjacent passengers or passersby and therefore the user can relax or sleep in comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the user places his or her palms against his or her upper body in the desired location, the region of material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along the palm of each of the hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> removably adheres to the material on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, the user can relax his or her shoulders and arms and permit the garment to bear the load of the dead weight of the arms. As a result, muscle strain and tendonitis in the arms and shoulders can be avoided. The first and second attachment means are chosen to be sufficiently strong such that the dead weight of the arms will not cause the first and second attachment means to separate disadvantageously. As discussed below, this garment can take many different forms; however, each of the forms is manufactured to be capable of providing the user with a reliable means to support of one or both arms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Additional components may be attached to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be provided for enhanced head and neck support. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with at least a region <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of second attachment means, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, for adhering to the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along the front shoulder region. The neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can include an additional region <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of second attachment means for attachment along the back of the user&apos;s collar on the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The neck pad may take a variety of forms, such as, for example, a stuffed pillow or an inflatable tube. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the neck pad <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> during use. In addition, similar pads may be attached to other areas of the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the garment, such as, for example, along the forearms, elbows or on a shoulder, for enhancing the user&apos;s comfort. Furthermore, pockets (not shown) may be attached to the upper portion at selectable locations for a wide variety of different purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative embodiment of a garment according to the present invention wherein the upper portion comprises a crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably attaches to itself at attachment location <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to form a loop. The loop of the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed over the head and is provided with first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A significant feature of this embodiment is the ability to take the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on and off quickly and easily, as compared with a sweater or vest. The crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may include a padded neck region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the crossing strap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of a garment according the to present invention wherein the upper portion is provided in the form of a non-crossing strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is placed around the back of the neck and lays over the front region of the shoulders. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a first attachment means at least along the strap ends <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> also includes a padded neck region <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for enhanced head and neck support. Hand portions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> similar to the gloves illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> may be used with the strap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as illustrated during use in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> illustrate alternative embodiments of hand portions comprising straps that are worn around the hands or wrists. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising palm straps <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that wrap around the palm region of the hand. Each palm strap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the hand portions comprising wrist straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Each wrist strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an attachment region <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided with a second attachment means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates yet another embodiment of the garment that is particularly well suited for immobilizing a victim&apos;s arm, such as, during rehabilitation after an injury. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the upper portion of the garment comprises a shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> adapted for wear across one shoulder. A region of first attachment means is provided at least along a region <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the exterior of the shoulder strap <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>.

As discussed above, the upper portion may be manufactured in a variety of different forms including, but not limited to, a shirt, sweater, vest or strap. Furthermore, the upper portion may be manufactured to be very durable for long-term use or may be manufactured to be disposable, such as for onetime use by passengers on an airplane, train or bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The entire upper portion may be made of a loop material fabric or, alternatively, the fabric may be provided along only a limited desired region. In addition, the upper portion may have loop material along one or both sides (i.e., it may be single or double-sided). An upper portion manufactured from a double-sided loop material may be reversible and may also provide the ability to attach articles, such as pockets, along both the exterior and interior of the upper portion. The upper portion may also include a zipper in the front, preferably made of a plastic material for increased comfort and for avoiding detection by metal detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The fabric used in the manufacture of the upper portion is preferably breathable, lightweight, washable, flame-retardant, waterproof and has a soft surface for comfort against the skin. In one preferred embodiment, the fabric comprises a laminated loop material such as VELTEX&reg; manufactured by VELCRO USA, Inc. VELTEX&reg; provides a relatively soft and even surface that is aesthetically pleasing and can be manufactured into a functional garment that can be worn for warmth or style in nearly any environment. In another preferred embodiment, the loop material comprises a medical grade laminate that provides increased attachment strength and improved duty cycles for durability over long periods. Medical grade laminates generally comprise a soft breathable foam substrate with knitted nylon loop provided along one or both surfaces thereof. VELCRO USA, Inc. provides a wide variety of medical grade laminates that are suitable for use with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The hand portions of the garment are preferably manufactured to include a region of hook material, at least along the palm or inner wrist, for providing a second attachment means for attachment with the first attachment means. As discussed above, the hand portions may be manufactured for wear along the hands, wrists or forearms. The gloves may be open-fingered for increased comfort and functionality, similar to weight lifting gloves (e.g., as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Although the first and second attachment means of the preferred embodiments are described above with respect to hook and loop materials, it will be appreciated that alternative first and second attachment means may also be used. For example, the invention may be used with attachment devices such as buttons, hooks, snaps and clasps or any other device wherein the first attachment means may be releasably attached to a second attachment means in a quick and easy manner. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that, when hook and loop materials are used, the hooks may be provided on the upper portion while the loops are provided on the hand portions, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the garment system of the present invention is very convenient to use. Due to the minimal number of components and ease of use, the garment may be easily transported or stored in small area. In addition, the garment system of the present invention is very versatile and can be used in a broad range of applications at home or during travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In certain applications, the garment system is usable by two or more persons. For example, in one application, the upper portion (e.g., a vest) is worn by a motorcycle rider while the hand portion (e.g., gloves) is worn by a passenger. In this application, the garment provides a safety mechanism by helping to ensure that the passenger&apos;s hands are firmly secured to the rider&apos;s upper body. In other applications, the upper portion and hand portions may be used for instructional purposes, such as hand placement during dancing, or for a wide variety of other instructional or recreational purposes, such as games and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While particular forms of the invention have been illustrated and described, it will also be appreciated that various additional modifications can also be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to exercise clothing, and more particularly to a vest with which one or more weights may be associated. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A variety of fitness and training techniques are known. A common training technique is the moving of a mass, such as a metal weight. In one form of training, one or more weights are either directly moved or mounted to a support which is moved. This type of training is known as &ldquo;free weight&rdquo; training. In another form of weight training, weights are associated with a mechanical apparatus. For example, a weight may be located at one end of a cable. The cable may pass over one or more pulleys to a handle or grip. The user grips the handle and moves the cable, and thus the weight attached to the cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem with both of these forms of weight training is that the apparatus or free weights are not suited to being transported. The user travels to the location of the weights or apparatus, exercises, and then leaves the location of the weights or apparatus. There are numerous drawbacks to this arrangement. Among these drawbacks are that the user can not train unless the user is at the location of the weights or apparatus. Another problem is that the user can not generally engage in other activities while training. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As one attempt to overcome these problems, ankle and wrist weights have been developed. These devices generally comprise a flexible annular member filled with metal shot. The weighted device may be placed around the ankle or wrist. So worn, the user may walk, run or engage in other activities which are generally not permitted when using free weights or weight apparatus. On the other hand, these devices still have significant drawbacks. One drawback is that all of the weight is concentrated at the angle or wrist, centralizing the load. This is uncomfortable and does not always yield the best training results. In addition, because the devices are attached to a generally circular area of the body, its is difficult to constrain the device while the user is moving. For example, while running these devices may move up and down with respect to the body, counteracting the desired training effect and interfering with the user&apos;s balance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other attempts at solving these problems have been unsuccessful as well. General problems associated with wearable weight systems are numerous. A significant problem is that such devices are not fully constrained and may move relative to the body. In general, training with these devices is most effective when the body is in motion, thus requiring movement of the associated weight device. However, because the device is not fully constrained, the heightened movement of the user during exercise generally results in heightened relative movement of the device. Again, this counteracts the desired training effect and can cause instability and discomfort to a user. In addition, it is desirable to be able to readily be able to change the amount of weight which is associated with the device and the location of the device. Current devices do not satisfactorily address these needs. </paragraph>

In one embodiment, this vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is particularly configured to be worn by a female, while the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are particularly designed to be worn by a male. In general, this embodiment vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is identical to the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> described above and illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, except that the arrangement of panels comprising a shell <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> differs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a first panel P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a shoulder portion of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Referring only to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, panels P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> constitute the rear portion of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A panel P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is located at the lower edge of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, this panel P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> preferably generally encircles the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the front of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a six panels P<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The panels defining opposing first and second sides, each having an edge which is connectable to the other with a zipper or other fastening member(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the panels P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are constructed of a material having a different color that the material forming the other panels. In this configuration, the panels create a visually appealing color patten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, means may be provided for selectively coupling the first and second sides of the front of the shell of the vest of the invention other than or in addition to the zipper, flap and straps. For example, buttons or snaps may be utilized, as may mating hook and loop fastening material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Use of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. It will be understood that use of the vest <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> is essentially the same. A user selects the particular weight or weights, if any, which they wish to associate with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Of course, a user may desire to not associate any weights with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and simply wear the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as configured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the weights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which are utilized with the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a configuration as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As illustrated, these weights are constructed from metal, such as cast iron or stainless steel. The weights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> are thin and generally rectangular in shape. As described in more detail below, this particular weight configuration has several advantages. Of course, a user may utilize weights having a variety of configurations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a user utilizes weights having a mass of approximately 1 pound for the compartments of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Weights having other masses may be used, such as 0.5 pounds or 2 pounds. Weights having a greater or lesser mass may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The user places a weight in each of the pockets <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as desired. In general, the user opens the flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> associated with each pocket to expose the fourth side or opening to each pocket or the compartments thereof. The user then places the desired weight in the pocket. In the preferred embodiment where each pocket includes a plurality of individual weight compartments, the user may place a weight in any or all of the compartments, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment where weights having a mass of 1 pound are used and the pockets have 40 compartments, the maximum mass of the weights which may be associated with the vest comprises 40 pounds. The total mass which may be associated with the vest may vary dependent upon the mass of the weights used, the number of weights used, and the number of compartments provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Next, the user closes the flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> associated with each pocket. The flap <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is secured into a closed position, such as by engaging the provided hook and loop fastening material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The user then places the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on their body. The user ensures that the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is unzipped and the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are disconnected, allowing movement of the first side <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> relative to the second side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The user extends their arms through the first and second arm openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and aligns their neck with the neck opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The user opens the sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> sufficient to extend them around the front of their torso. The user then zips the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, securing the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the front <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to one another. In addition, the user optionally secures the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. To do so, the user pulls the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> across the first side <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and secures it with the hook and loop fastening material or other means for connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the user may also connect opposing portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the first strap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the opposing portions <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the second strap <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to one another. If necessary, the user may shorten or lengthen the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to obtain a snug and secure fit of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their body. It will be appreciated that by changing the length of the straps, the user may change the size of the perimeter of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at its bottom edge. By reducing the size of the perimeter, the user tightens the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about their body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> With the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so positioned on their body, a user may engage in any of a variety of activities. These activities may include specific exercises, such as running, lunges, squats, push-ups, sit-ups and other activities. The user may also engage in activities which are not specifically intended to be exercises, such as household chores, walking, shopping and the like. Regardless, the additional weight which is borne by the user is useful in working the user&apos;s various muscles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> One or more of the steps of use may occur in an order other than described above. For example, a user may place the vest on their body, and then place one or more weights in the vest. In addition, a user may remove weights from the vest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention has numerous advantages and overcomes significant problems associated with prior art exercise apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a vest is provided which is capable of accepting weights, where the weights are secured. First, the weights are located in individual pockets or compartments, preventing the weights from shifting during movement of the wearer or from falling from the vest. In addition, the weights are located in pockets which are located at the interior of the shell of the vest. When the vest is worn, the weights are tightly held between the wearer&apos;s body and the shell of the vest, securely holding the weights in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The construction of the vest contributes to the high degree to which the weights are secured. As indicated above, a significant problem with prior devices is that the weights may move relative to a user. This problem is exacerbated when the user&apos;s movements are accentuated, such as when the user exercises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a vest is provided which secures the weights so that the weights do not move relative to the user&apos;s body. Because the weights move with, and not relative to the user&apos;s body, problems such as imbalance, discomfort and the like are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> As indicated, in a preferred embodiment, the shell is constructed of multiple panels. These panels can be customized in size and shape, so that the assembled vest is adapted to fit a particular wearer perfectly. As noted, the vest of the invention may be specially configured to be worn by a female (ex. FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) or a male (ex. FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). Any particular vest configuration may be provided. For example, two different users may have a shoulder area having the same size and shape, but have a different mid-torso area. In that event, when considering the embodiment vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the panels P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,P<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may be the same for each vest, but the panels P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be larger in the case of one of the vests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The material from which the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed also contributes to the securing of the weights. As described, in a preferred embodiment, the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed from a durable but flexible/elastic material. Preferably, the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sized so that it fits the user snugly. In one embodiment, when the user zips the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are pulled towards one another, tightly encircling the user. The elasticity of the vest material permits sufficient stretching of the material that any gap between the first and second sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> before the zipper <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is zipped is closed when the zipper is zipped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> So that the weights associated with the pockets <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> along the lower edge of the vest are secured, the user preferably tightens the straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The straps <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the flap <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> permit the wearer to specifically tighten the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> against their body in the location of these weights, compressing the weights between the vest and their body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention is that the vest permits location of the weights in anatomically advantageous positions. First, one or more weights may be located near the bottom edge of the vest, corresponding to the user&apos;s waist. In this location, the weights are secured about the structurally sound hip area of the body. This area of the body is adapted to carry heavy loads, and is centrally located such that the extra weight is unlikely to interfere with balance. Second, weights may be located in an area corresponding to the front and rear shoulder, adjacent each arm. Again, the body is adapted to support loads in the shoulder area. In addition, the mind and body are already design to address balance (or imbalance) arising from movement of the arms. The weights are similarly located and thus do not generally effect the balance or other movements of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Location of the weights in different areas is also advantageous since such permits the weights to be useful in a greater variety of situations. For example, any weights associated with the vest are useful in training when running, jumping or the like. When doing sit-ups, however, the weights located at the lower edge of the vest are near the pivot point of the body, and have less effect than do weights located in the pockets near the arm openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The construction of the vest is such that it is extremely comfortable. Another problem with prior devices is that when applied to the body, they are often not comfortable. This leads to a user stopping the use of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in one embodiment, the comfort of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> arises from its multi-panel construction. This construction permits the vest to be particularly sized and shaped to fit the body. In addition, the shell of the vest comprises a somewhat elastic material, allowing the shell to conform to the shape of the body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also comprises a separate shell and lining. As will be appreciated, during exercise if an article of clothing tightly adheres to the body but moves even slightly relative thereto, then a rubbing effect results. The user may get blisters or scrapes as a result of this relative movement. In accordance with the invention, the lining acts as a buffer between the more rigid structural shell and the user&apos;s body. Some movement of this shell is permitted relative to the lining, which protects the underlying body of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The lining also lends directly to the comfort of the vest <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As indicated, the shell of the vest is preferably constructed of a durable material such as a cotton/nylon, rayon or poly blend. While this type of material is advantageous because of its structural abilities, the material does not breathe well. The lining is a mesh material which includes perforations which permit air to flow there through. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the above described arrangements of apparatus and the method therefrom are merely illustrative of applications of the principles of this invention and many other embodiments and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Application of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a headgear structure with a transformable peak, and particularly relates to a headgear structure which, in combination with a peak secured to the front edge of the crown, can be bent anytime and anywhere to form the peak style of varying bending arcs, thus enabling the wearers to match their clothing and enhance their personal style; the peaked headgear can bear different visual effects by simply changing the style of the peak, so as to be suitable to all kinds of peaked headgear structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> People adore outdoor entertainment/sports which, however, can easily cause severe sun burn. For as long as the head-wearable caps have been designed and extensively used, the styling and aesthetic effects of the caps have been of concern to the consumers. Varying caps are worn depending on different timing, occasion and clothing, rendering the derivation of various types of peaked headgear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Taking the essential structure and style of a sports cap shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for example, the cap, basically a leisure cap (or baseball cap), has six gores seamed to form a crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> secured to the front edge of the crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to satisfy sun block requirements. The structure of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes a plastic board in-between the upper and lower fabric layers, and a seam <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is formed on the brim of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The outer appearance of the conventional cap cannot be greatly varied based on the reasons that the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is usually made of rigid plastic in the form of a flat or fixed first quarter moon shape, thus preventing any method of styling. Given the single style and the unadjustable peak shape, the cap cannot provide the feature of free adjustment and shaping. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The primary object of the present invention is to provide a headgear structure with a transformable peak, the structure and design of the peak permit free bending to alter the outline thereof, rendering variation in the overall appearance of the cap and subsequently increasing its aesthetic and novelty effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a headgear structure with a transformable peak which includes flexible elements provided on the seam portion between the top peak fabric and the under peak fabric being outer cover layers for peak board. After said flexible elements are bent and shaped, said peak board can be set to an arc shape along with the flexible elements, thus increasing the effect of varying the outer appearance of the peaked headgear. Besides, while the flexible elements can be made of metal or non-metal having the feature of being flexed and adjusted to a set shape, the peak board is in the form of a relatively soft laminate, so that after the flexible elements of the peak are bent, the rigid stress of the flexible elements is greater than the resilience of the peak board, thereby the peak board can be set to an arc shape along with the flexible elements, and the outer appearance of the peaked headgear can be varied to satisfy different wearers&apos; fondness. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an outer appearance of a cap of prior art. As previously described, the peak thereof cannot be freely adjusted, and thus decreases the value of its utility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 2</cross-reference>A, a cap according to an embodiment of the invention is formed of a cap crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via a seam, and the structure of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided inside thereof; the upper and lower sides of the peak board are sheathed by a known fabric layer. Flexible metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are invisibly provided inside of the seam in the front of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). In this way, the peak will become integrated with the cap crown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be bent to certain angles can be common metal, such as copper, iron, aluminum, etc., whereas the sheathing fabric layer is water-proof. The cords may also be made of flexible non-metal, so as to avoid rust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A, while comparing the embodiment of the invention with the cap shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the flexible metal cord <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be replaced by a metal cord <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sheathed by a water-proof plastic sheet <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, so that the sheathing fabric layer of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must not necessarily be water-proof and no rust would occur to the metal cords <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sheathed inside thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>, as the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with the flexible elements, the present invention can permit the wearers to freely bend the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the flexible metal cords <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provided on the front edge of the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to change their arc shapes, thus styling the intended shape of the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, as the peak board <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provided on the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the form of a soft laminate, so long as the metal or non-metal cords are flexed, the peak can greatly change its shape via forcible bending as shown, and therefore the peak <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>becomes a fashionable style as illustrated, which is liked by youth. That is one of the benefits of the invention for making the cap style younger and more attractive in appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In addition, the appended drawings only show the flexible elements invisibly provided inside of the peak, like the design concept of the invention, if the flexible elements are provided on the seams in-between the top and under peaks of the cap (as shown in part B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). It can also obtain the feature of flexing the peak to different shapes and thus is included in the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the invention can improve the dull style of the prior art, by providing the flexible elements in the peak to enable a change of the style thereof and, in turn, the style of the cap. Therefore, the effect of varying the cap style with matching decorations on the cap can be reached. The utility of the peak according to the invention is greatly increased, since it can suit all kinds of peaked headgear, and with the doubtless value, the inventor of the invention claims the exposure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a collapsible garment and a method for using the same. More particularly, the invention relates to a swimsuit that can be folded into its belt or a pouch attached to the belt without the necessity of taking the garment off and a method for manufacturing such a swimsuit. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the &ldquo;back to nature&rdquo; movement and in enjoying life unencumbered by clothes. Most jurisdictions have regulations against public nudity and this acts as a restraint on those who would like to enjoy life in pretty much the state in which they were born. People will be people and those who would like to swim &ldquo;in the raw&rdquo;, so to speak, have two choices if they wish to act unfettered: (a) wear no clothing, or, (b) wear a swimsuit on the beach and take it all off when at a safe distance from any Peeping Toms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As noted above, option (a) is usually illegal and, in many instances, people are not disposed to so appear in public. There is also the problem of finding a deserted location at which to take off the swimsuit. Facilities for discrete donning and removal of clothing may not exist at beaches and swimming pools. Removing clothing also presents problems in cold and/or windy weather. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Option (b), while aesthetically more appealing to the public at large, presents dangers to the swimmer. Taking the swimsuit off under water requires either bending down or stepping out of the swimsuit and can be dangerous and has the problem of collecting sand and grit inside the swimsuit. There is the additional problem of holding on to the garment once it has been taken off: if both hands are not devoted to the task, there is the risk of losing the swimsuit and the swimmer is back to the situation presented in option (a). Prior art swimsuits also present problems in putting the swimsuit back on. There is difficulty in identifying the proper holes into which legs must go, particularly in active surf. Once back on, any accumulated sand and grit can be very uncomfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,920 to Holland, the contents of which are fully incorporated herein by reference, teaches a swimsuit that includes a body and a belt, a portion of the body encircling a portion of the belt to form at least one pouch. The other end of the body has fastening devices that attach them to the belt opposite the pouch to form a conventional-looking swimsuit. Detaching the clips, folding up the body and inserting it into the pouch(es) gives a compact arrangement of a belt with a small pouch attached to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention of Holland is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (Prior Art). As shown, the swimsuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> adapted to encircle a human waist. The belt defines an inside and an outside. The belt is preferably made of a fabric with some ability to stretch so as to maintain a snug fit with the waist of the person wearing the garment. The swimsuit also includes a body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, one end <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of which defines a pair of pouches (storage compartments) <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that enclose a portion of the belt. The sides of pouches are maintained in sliding contact with the portion of the belt that they encircle and are provided with openings purpose of which will be discussed below. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pouches are separated by a seam <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the middle, the seam coupling the body part <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. An alternated embodiment of the invention has a single pouch extending all the way across the back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention of Holland, while being fully adapted for the function for which it was designed, was found to have some drawbacks. Drawbacks are purely aesthetic. When the swimsuit is fully folded into the pouch surrounding the belt may, it may have a bulky appearance. In addition, when the swimsuit is in the configuration for wear on the beach, it may be difficult to configure the top rear of the suit for a perfect fit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a swimsuit that enables the law abiding swimmer to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Such a swimsuit should allow the swimmer to enter the water discretely clothed. Such a swimsuit should preferably be safe and easy to disengage from the human body. Such a swimsuit should remain attached to the human body without the use of hands. Such a swimsuit should be easy to put back on. In addition, it should preferably be aesthetically appealing in both the engaged and disengaged positions. The swimsuit should also be easy to manufacture. The present invention satisfies this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention is a modification of a conventional swimsuit that has a pair of detachable fasteners. When the fasteners are decoupled, the portion of the swimsuit encircling human legs is &ldquo;opened up&rdquo; and may be rolled into a compact size that can be stowed inside a pouch on the swimsuit. Support for the swimsuit is provided by a loop that at least partially encircles a human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a method of using the novel swimsuit so as to appear covered up in the closed configuration of the swimsuit and to be able to open up the swimsuit while the swimsuit is supported by a loop around the human waist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another aspect of the present invention is a method of making a novel collapsible swimsuit by attaching a loop and a plurality of fastening devices to a prior art swimsuit that has been altered.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is best understood with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that illustrate the arrangement of the various parts of the swimsuit. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is shown. The swimsuit includes a loop <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> attached to the swimsuit to at least partially enclose a human waist: the exact manner in which it encircles the human waist is discussed below. The loop may be made of any suitable material but in a preferred embodiment of the invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> preferably comprises a decorative chain that is made of material resistant to corrosion by seawater. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop comprises a tubular member such as a cord or &ldquo;piping&rdquo;. Two fasteners <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the swimsuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are shown in the engaged position so that the swimsuit appears at first sight to be a conventional swimsuit with a decorative loop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the swimsuit is shown in the disengaged configuration with the fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>now showing its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; disengaged into its components and fastener <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>disengaged into its components <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. In the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, another feature of the swimsuit becomes apparent: the rear of the swimsuit is seen to have an additional piece of fabric <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (with a seam <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>) that defines a pouch between the member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the rear of the swimsuit. The pouch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> has two openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the loop member is preferably inserted into the pouch (storage compartment). In one embodiment of the invention, the loop member may pass completely through the pouch and thus be capable of fully encircling the human waist. In an alternate embodiment of the invention, the loop member may be fastened at two places (not shown) to the rear of the swimsuit and thus only partially encircle the human waist. Other configurations of the swimsuit may include two pouches as taught in Holland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As taught in Holland, the body of the swimsuit may be rolled up and inserted for storage into the pouch or storage compartment. As discussed in Holland, this is accomplished by rolling up the portion of the swimsuit disengaged from the portion of the swimsuit proximate to the loop and inserting the rolled up portion into the pouch. This is shown in after rolling up and storing in the pouch in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Details of the method of rolling up and storing are discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, a method of making the swimsuit discussed above is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a conventional swimsuit <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. By separating the swimsuit, e.g. by cutting, at locations indicated by <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> results. Manufacture of the swimsuit of the present invention then requires the addition of a piece of fabric <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> to the swimsuit by a seam such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to define a storage compartment with ends <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> shown, the addition of fastening devices at or near the locations of the separation points <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the incorporation of the loop <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> to give a result that would appear to be substantially the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The advantages of this method of making the swimsuit would be clear since this modification could be done to &ldquo;off the rack&rdquo; items that are widely available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The method in which the swimsuit is stored within itself is shown using the teachings of Holland as an example. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates the invention of Holland when the fasteners are disengaged and the body is rolled up tightly to abut the pouches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> encircling the belt <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The body in the rolled up position is depicted by <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>&prime;. Also shown are the openings <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> in the pouches <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Because the pouches of Holland are made of the same material as the body and are flexible, the rolled up body can be inserted into the openings and at the same time, the edges of the opening <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> folded back to the position <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the ends of the opening have been folded back from both sides. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, when the clips are disengaged, the body rolled up, and the ends of the opening folded back, the entire garment collapses to a compact shape defined by the belt and the small enclosure around it. The same method is used in the present invention for rolling up and storing the swimsuit within itself using the openings <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an illustration of an alternate embodiment of a swimsuit in what is commonly known as a &ldquo;thong&rdquo; swimsuit. Shown is a swimsuit <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> with a &ldquo;thong&rdquo; portion <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> extending to the back of the swimsuit, the front of the swimsuit having a width greater than the width of the thong at the back of the swimsuit. The swimsuit is provided with a pouch <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> defined by the seam <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of a piece of fabric attached to the body of the swimsuit. To simplify the illustration, the openings of the pouch are not shown. A chain <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> (or piping or other tubular member) defines a loop that can encircle the human waist. Alternatively, element <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may be an integral part of the body of the swimsuit. As with the embodiment discussed above, the chain or tubular member may circle the human waist partially or entirely. The end of the thong is provided with a fastener <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> for attaching to the chain <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. One important difference between this embodiment of the invention and the one discussed above (and in Holland) is that the pouch is now in the front rather than in the back. The method of folding and stowing remain the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments, with the attainment of some or all of the advantages of the invention. Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of the invention </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a helmet that is particularly well suited for cold-weather use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A prior art helmet comprises a head portion that protects the head of a wearer, as a conventional helmet; a jaw shield, which is integrated with and forms a projection with the head portion and protects the lower part of the face of the wearer, more particularly the jaw; and an eye shield, which is situated between an upper front section of the head portion and an upper section of the jaw shield to protect the face of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to its structure, the helmet has a small interior chamber. This interior chamber is usually insulated from the atmosphere to protect the wearer from cold air. At a certain temperature, water vapor in the humid air exhaled by the wearer will create condensation. Because the temperature of the lens of the eyeglasses of the operator wearing the helmet or the eye shield of the helmet can reach the condensation point of the breath of the wearer, water and/or ice will form on the eyeglass lens or on the eye shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To avoid the problem of condensation, it is possible to open the shield to allow outside air to flow into the helmet until the condensation is eliminated. This, however, presents a problem in that the wearer may be exposed to cold air, which is uncomfortable at the very least. Furthermore, the wearer has to use one hand to open the shield, which may be awkward when he or she is steering the vehicle being driven. The shield could also involuntarily close as a result of a sudden movement, which is potentially distracting. Thus, there is a need to provide a device which is capable of avoiding or eliminating the condensation created inside a full face helmet. There is a further need to provide such a device with an adjustment mechanism that can be manipulated by a wearer who is wearing gloves to protect his/her hands from the cold environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Prior art helmets provide some protection against the sun&apos;s rays. However, the shield of prior art helmets is either clear or tinted and adjustment of the tint is usually not possible. On a bright sunny day, the wearer of a prior art helmet also must wear tinted eyeglasses to protect himself against the intensity of light, if the shield of his helmet is clear. In changing weather conditions, the wearer may have to remove and/or replace his tinted eyeglasses (or sunglasses) as the intensity of light changes. Thus, a need has developed for a helmet with an adjustable tinted shield. Because, as discussed above, the helmet wearer typically will wear both gloves and a helmet in a cold environment, there is a need to provide a tinted shield adjustment mechanism that can be controlled by the wearer while the wearer is wearing gloves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Helmets that are adapted for cold-weather use are commonly equipped with electrically-heated eye shields that prevent water vapor from condensing and/or freezing on the eye shield. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,694,650 and 5,500,953 illustrate two examples of such heated eye shields. In each, an electric heating element extends across the eye shield, which is pivotally or otherwise movably connected to the helmet. The eye shield includes an electric connector that connects to an external power supply via power supply leads. If the wearer is riding a snowmobile, the power supply is typically the snowmobile&apos;s battery. In these conventional heated eye shields, the power supply leads act as tethers between the eye shield and the power source and tend to disadvantageously move the heated eye shield during use. There is therefore a need to provide an electrical connection between a heated eye shield and an external power source that does not tend to move the eye shield relative to the helmet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/075,992, which published on Aug. 8, 2002 as US 2002/0104533 A1 and is incorporated by reference herein, discloses another conventional helmet. The helmet comprises a head portion, a shield portion, and a breathing mask. The shield portion comprises a jaw shield and an eye shield. The jaw shield is pivotally connected to the head portion and can be pivoted downwardly into a closed position and upwardly into an open position. The eye shield is pivotally connected to the head portion and includes a see-through shield and a tinted shield. The tinted shield is pivotally connected to the eye shield and can be lowered inside the helmet to protect the wearer from sun rays and raised into an upper, enclosed portion of the eye shield. The breathing mask is hermetically adapted to the face of the wearer to evacuate the wearer&apos;s breath outside the helmet through breathing channels that extend laterally outwardly and rearwardly through the jaw shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In summary, there are several deficiencies in prior art helmets that necessitate an improved helmet design. This is especially true for the design of helmets specifically intended for cold weather use, such as for snowmobiling or the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Before delving into the specific details of the present invention, it should be noted that the conventions &ldquo;left,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;front,&rdquo; &ldquo;rear,&rdquo; &ldquo;up,&rdquo; and &ldquo;down&rdquo; are defined relative to the head of a wearer of a helmet. For example, a &ldquo;forward&rdquo; direction is the direction in which the wearer looks while wearing a helmet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a side view of a helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is adapted to protect a majority of the wearer&apos;s head. A jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connects to a lower forward portion of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> together define an inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that is shaped to accommodate the head of the wearer. The inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> opens to the exterior of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at a semi-crescent-shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes when the wearer wears the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is defined between a forward edge of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an upper edge of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes left and right sides/portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that extend forwardly and laterally inwardly toward each other from left and right forward lower sides, respectively, of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generally from a convex arc around the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are integrally formed with the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. However, the sides <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may alternatively be formed separately from the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and then rigidly attached to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> laterally-extending pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> extends between lower portions of the left and right forward, inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the left and right portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> receiving opening is defined between the inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, an upper edge of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, and a lower edge of the semi-crescent-shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The receiving opening is adapted to be disposed generally in front of a mouth and nose of the wearer of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has an attached position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) where the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rigidly held at a lower, front, middle portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (i.e., in the receiving opening for the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also has a detached position in which the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not rigidly attached to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 4</cross-reference>). However, even in the detached position, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be tethered to the rest of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a tether cord (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is selectively attached to the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> using a separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Details of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes two parts. One part is defined by the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, which preferably has a round cross-section. The other part is a C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that is attached to a lower, laterally-centered portion of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends laterally along the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> over a width that preferably generally corresponds to an exposed laterally-extending length of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The cross-section of the clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, as it extends laterally, is defined by the C-shape. The opening of the &ldquo;C&rdquo; preferably aims generally forwardly and slightly downwardly when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While in the illustrated embodiment, the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is disposed on the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is disposed on the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the relative positions of the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be interposed without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, because other types of separable hinges may also be used, the present invention is not limited to the hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, to engage the two parts of the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is aimed forwardly and downwardly in front of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is moved downwardly such that the C-shape engages the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can thereafter be pivoted upwardly and rearwardly toward the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> about a pivot axis defined by the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. When the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is pivoted fully into its attached position, the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> automatically rigidly engages upper portions of the fixed and detachable portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to prevent the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from pivoting away from the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The engagement between the outer lateral sides of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> prevents the C-shaped clip <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from moving rearwardly relative to the pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from separating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generally form a U shape. The lower edge of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> also forms a U shape that mates with the U shape of the sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the intersection between the fixed and detachable portions <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may take on a variety of other shapes (see, e.g., the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a partial front view of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with a front cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</cross-reference>) removed. The two lateral sides of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are mirror images of each other in the embodiment shown. Accordingly, only the left side will be described because the description applies to the right side as well. The left side of the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that is pivotally connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may move in the direction indicated by the arrows. A resilient member (i.e., a spring, etc.) <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends between the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to bias the lever <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally outwardly (clockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). A hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about a generally horizontal axis so that the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may move in the directions indicated by the arrows. A resilient member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> (i.e., a torsion spring, a tension spring, etc.) extends between the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to bias a downwardly-pointing hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is formed at a laterally outward and rearward end of the hook arm <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, downwardly into an engaged position (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The hook <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is generally disposed at an upper, rearward, laterally-outward end of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> further includes a slot (or catch plate) <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> disposed at an upper end of the inner side <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the left portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (and of the right portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> To engage the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is engaged and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated upwardly toward the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> abut lower edges of the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is rotated almost fully upwardly. The abutting contact pushes the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> upwardly against the biasing force of the resilient members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to pass into the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> thereafter rotate downwardly, under the biasing force of the resilient members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, to engage the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and rigidly hold the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> against the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To release the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the wearer depresses two triangularly-shaped protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally-inwardly. The levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are positioned to enable a wearer to depress both levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> laterally inwardly by squeezing the protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> together with a single hand. The resulting inward lateral movement of the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> causes the levers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to engage second arms <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the hook arms <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, thereby rotating the hook arms <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> upwardly into a disengaged position relative to the slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can thereafter be freely rotated outwardly and downwardly away from the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to allow the wearer to separate the separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and detach the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Because the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes two independently operating hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the accidental actuation of just one of the hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> will not release the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. This safety feature prevents the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from accidentally releasing during use of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> forms the forward side of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The protrusions <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extend forwardly through triangularly shaped holes <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> on either lateral side of the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> utilizes left and right sets of hooks <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and slots <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, various other types of latch mechanisms may also be used to releasably secure the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the connection could be magnetic, rather than mechanical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> When the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position, rearward laterally-outward ends of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> engage sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> disposed on the forward inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the fixed portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). The sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> preferably comprise an elastically deformable material such as foam or rubber. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> discourage cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the detachable and fixed portions <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, a breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is adjustably connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via an adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> connects to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for free rotation relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about an axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. However, the connection between the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> prevents the knob from moving along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is specifically connected to the cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, but may alternatively be connected to the main body of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> intersects a generally forward, middle portion of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and generally intersects the wearer&apos;s mouth and nose when the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> includes a central, internally-threaded bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> an outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes, on its outer semi-cylindrical surface, an externally-threaded portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> that is threaded into the internally threaded bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) of the control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> such that the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> connects to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via its connection to the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes an inner axially extending bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that extends along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> generally comprises a hollow, axially-extending tube that has a generally ring-shaped cross-section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> An inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes an outer generally-cylindrical surface that telescopically fits into the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> also includes an internal axially-extending bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> when the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is fit into the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the outer semi-cylindrical surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes an axially-extending surface feature/stop (a flat portion in the illustrated embodiment) <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> that engages a corresponding axially-extending surface feature/stop <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> (also a flat portion in the illustrated embodiment) formed on the inside of the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to prevent the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to each other about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, while allowing the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to telescopically axially slide relative to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the outer semi-cylindrical surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the inside semi-cylindrical surface of the bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also include annular stops <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (such as notches and/or protrusions) that discourage relative telescopic movement between the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 23</cross-reference>, a rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> flares radially-outwardly and rearwardly in the shape of a funnel. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a central bore <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> that is slightly larger than the generally-cylindrical outer surface of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> extends forwardly through the central bore <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. An annular, saucer-shaped, breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> also fits over the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to clamp the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> onto the rearward axial end of the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> between the flared rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> cannot, therefore, move along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Because the rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> are both somewhat flexible, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can swivel relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In other words, the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can pivot to some extent relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can therefore swivel to fit the face of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> ring-shaped upper end of an accordion-folded connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is clamped between the flared rearward axial end <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask clamp <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> in addition to the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is either rigidly clamped to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> or includes a notch that engages a corresponding protrusion in the inner axial member to prevent the upper end the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The locations of the notch and protrusion, of course, may be interposed. The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a piece of sheet metal that is folded in an accordion pattern, which provides at least a moderate amount of flexibility. A lower end of the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> generally prevents the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise a variety of other shapes and materials. For example, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may simply comprise a string or tether that connects between the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the detachable jaw portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to discourage the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, while the illustrated connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> comprises an accordion-shaped sheet of metal, the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise a variety of other materials such as rubber, another elastomeric material, string, plastic, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes both fine and gross adjustment devices. The adjustment devices each move the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> along an axial path defined by the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such that the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can move (a) away from an interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and toward the mouth and nose of the wearer and (b) toward the interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and away from the mouth and nose of the wearer. Unlike prior art breathing mask adjustment devices that rely on flexible straps and the wearer&apos;s face to hold the breathing mask in place, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> controls the position of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> regardless of whether or not the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can hold the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s nose and mouth while the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without having the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> come in contact with the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Gross adjustment of the breathing mask is performed by pushing or pulling the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to telescopically move relative to each other despite the frictional resistance to such telescopic movement created by the annular stops <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> on the axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Gross adjustment can be performed while the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is detached from the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but not in the attached position, or when the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Once the gross adjustment of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is completed, the wearer uses the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to finely adjust the axial position of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Fine adjustment is preferably performed while the wearer is wearing the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the attached position such that the wearer can accurately and precisely position the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> against his/her mouth and nose to prevent humid exhaled air from escaping out of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> preferably includes surface features such as protrusions and/or notches <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that make it easier for the wearer to turn the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with his/her gloved hand. By rotating the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with his/her hand, the threaded engagement between the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> causes the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (and consequently the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) to move along the axial path. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be rotated in either direction, resulting in movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> toward or away from the inner surface of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pitch of the threads on the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the bore <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> determine the magnitude of axial movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> per degree of rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If right-hand threads are used on the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, clockwise rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> (as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) will push the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> outwardly toward the interior surface of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and away from the wearer&apos;s mouth and nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> For rotation of the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to force the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to move axially, the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> should not rotate significantly with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is therefore prevented from rotating significantly with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> because of the rotational engagement of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which is prevented from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that other systems may alternatively be used to prevent the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from rotating with the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. For example, an axially extending notch or protrusion could be formed in the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and mate with a radially-inwardly extending notch or protrusion that is rigidly connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Such mating notches/protrusions would directly prevent the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could rely on a general contact between the wearer&apos;s face and the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to prevent the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (and, consequently, the outer and inner axial members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) from significantly rotating relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during operation of the fine adjustment device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>, left and right inlet air passageways (or openings) <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are formed in the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to fluidly connect the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an inner portion (or breathing space) <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and allow the wearer to inhale air from within the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Check valves <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> disposed within the inlet air passages <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> discourage humid exhaled air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and condensing within the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the wearer inhales air from within the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the inhaled air is at least slightly warmed (relative to the ambient environment) and air continuously circulates into and out of the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Fresh air enters the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through any openings/gaps in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, especially at the neck of the wearer. While the illustrated air inlet passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> are quite short (i.e., extending only over the thickness of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>), the air inlet passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> may alternatively comprise elongated tubular passageways that have a variety of lengths and/or cross-sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The internal bore <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> in the inner axial member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the internal bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> combine to define an exhaust air passageway (or opening) <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> fluidly connects the inner portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the ambient environment to allow humid air exhaled by the wearer to vent outwardly without getting into the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> check valve <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> is disposed in the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to prevent ambient air outside the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from entering the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. While the illustrated exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> comprises an elongated tube, the passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may alternatively be short in an axial direction. While the cross-sectional shape of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is generally circular in this embodiment, the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> may have a variety of alternative tubular shapes (for example, rectangular, oval, irregular, polygonal, or varying shapes) without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The center of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends along the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, when a person <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight> wears the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and the exhaust air passage <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> angle downwardly as the air passageway projects away from the mouth and nose of the person <highlight><bold>269</bold></highlight>. Because an external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is disposed below an internal end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, humid exhaled air that condenses in the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> will tend to flow under the force of gravity down the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and out of the external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>opens up to the ambient environment in a forward and downward direction. Consequently, condensed water will tend not to accumulate or freeze within the passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> extends linearly such that the axis <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> defines its center, exhaust air passageways according to the present invention may have a variety of alternative longitudinal shapes (e.g., center lines that include simple or compound curves, irregular shapes, angles, etc.). Regardless of the specific longitudinal shape of the exhaust air passageway, the air passageway should generally extend downwardly as it extends away from the wearer&apos;s face so that condensed water tends to flow out of the air passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> To discourage fresh air from being forced into the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> as the wearer travels forwardly on a vehicle, an air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</cross-reference>) fits into the inner bore <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and is positioned in front of the external end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> to deflect air away from the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is open on its sides to allow exhaled air to exit the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. The air deflector <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and the exhaust air check valve <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> combine to generally discourage ambient fresh air from entering the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. Consequently, more warm exhaled air than cold ambient air moves through the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, which generally raises the temperature within the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> and discourages the humid exhaust air from condensing and freezing within the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. This discourages ice from building up within and clogging the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> While separate exhaust and inlet air passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> are preferred, the inlet air passageways <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and check valves <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> may be eliminated such that the exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> serves as a passageway for both inlet/fresh air and exhaled humid air without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Various modifications to the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be made without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, just one of the two adjustment devices (telescopic/rotational) may be used. Further, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> instead of to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may freely rotate relative to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, but be prevented from moving axially relative to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may include external threads that would mesh with internal threads rigidly formed in a bore in the detachable portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Additional changes and modifications may also be made to the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the present invention, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected by left and right bolts <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally extending tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is pivotally movable between (a) a raised position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is at least partially above the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and substantially out of the wearer&apos;s field of vision (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), and (b) a lowered position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed in the semi-crescent shaped opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> connects between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to bias the tinted shield into its raised position. Alternatively, the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> could connect between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and an eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The illustrated resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> is a torsion spring that is pre-tensioned before the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the torsion spring <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> urges the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> upwardly (clockwise as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) into its raised position so that the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> will not fall into its lowered position under the force of gravity or some jostling movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> comprises a semi-spherical semi-crescent shaped tinted see-through portion <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> with left and right sides <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> riveted or otherwise attached to the laterally-outer ends of the see-through portion <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the lower edge of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> generally follows the contours of the upper edge of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a partial side view of the left inside of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> with the tinted shield removed from the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A hole <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> through which the bolt <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> fits is disposed through the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> is disposed between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to selectively hold the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in its lowered position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The illustrated holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> includes a rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that is formed on the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The long edges of the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are generally perpendicular to a line that connects between the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a middle of the long edges of the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is radially spaced from the axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> disposed on the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. When the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the shallowly-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> face rearwardly and the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> face forwardly. The teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> are generally aligned with a forward small edge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> disposed on an outer lateral side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> radially outwardly from the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The steeply-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> face forwardly and slightly downwardly while the shallowly-sloped sides of the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> face rearwardly and slightly upwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are positioned so as to not engage the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position. However, when the tinted shield is pivoted toward and into the lowered position, the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are positioned to engage the ratchet teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. When the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> meet each other, their respective shallowly-sloped sides first engage each other, thereby forcing the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> outwardly. Because the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is made of a flexible material such as plastic, the rectangular tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> flexes outwardly (generally about the small edge <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>) away from the head portion <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The outward movement of the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> enables the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to slide over the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> until the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> flexes back into its unflexed position, at which point the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> engage the steeply-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to prevent the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from rotating back into its raised position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Because there are a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a plurality of lowered positions of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are defined, one lowered position for each possible combination of mating teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> A variety of other types of holding devices may be used instead of the illustrated ratchet-teeth-based holding device, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference> illustrates a helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> that includes an alternative holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> may replace the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Because the helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is similar to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a redundant description of each of the similar elements is omitted. The helmet <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>, a jaw shield <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, an eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, and a tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> disposed between the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally extending tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. The tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is pivotally movable between (a) a raised position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is at least partially above an opening <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> formed between the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and substantially out of the wearer&apos;s field of vision (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>), and (b) a lowered position, in which the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is disposed in the semi-crescent shaped opening <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> in front of the wearer&apos;s eyes (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> A resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> connects between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> to bias the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> into its raised position. In this embodiment, the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is a resilient plastic spring that is connected at one end to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and at an opposite end to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. Because the plastic spring <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is resiliently bent around a base portion of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> biases the tinted shield into its raised position. While the illustrated resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is a plastic spring, a variety of other resilient members may alternatively be used to bias the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> upwardly (for example, a torsion spring such as the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> rubber band or other tensile piece of rubber, a tension spring, a compression spring, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is disposed between the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and the head portion. The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> selectively holds the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> in its lowered position despite the raising force being applied to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> includes a lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> and a detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, which selectively engage each other to hold the tinted shield in the lowered position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from one side of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. The illustrated lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the base portion of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, but may alternatively be otherwise attached to the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> (via, for example, glue, bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> pivots with the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> about the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. The lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> comprises a flexible material that enables an upper portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> to flex in the direction of the tinted shield axis (into and out of the page as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> protrudes inwardly from an upper rearward portion of the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. However, the detent may alternatively be otherwise attached to the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> (via, for example, glue, bolts, screws, rivets, etc.). A forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> abuts against a rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> to prevent the tinted shield from moving from its lowered position into its raised position when the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is lowered. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> are both in their lowered positions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> into its raised position pivots the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> rearwardly away from the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight>, which allows the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> to move into its raised position under the force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> are both in their lowered positions (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>), the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may be raised without raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by pressing the upper, exposed portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>. Pressing the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly causes its upper portion to flex inwardly and its rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to disengage from the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and pivot rearwardly past the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This, in turn, allows the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> to move into its raised position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> A rearward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> angles inwardly toward the head portion <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> as it progresses forwardly toward the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Consequently, the detent <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a generally ramp-like shape when viewed from above. When the eye shield is in the lowered position and the tinted shield is in its raise position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>), the wearer can lower the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> by pushing the exposed portion of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> forward (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 and 26</cross-reference>). As the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> passes the detent, the ramp-like, rearward surface <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>flexes the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> inwardly so that it can slide past the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. Once the rearward surface of the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> moves in front of the forward surface <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>, the lever <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> flexes outwardly and engages the detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> to hold the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> in its lowered position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The illustrated detent <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> is mounted to the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> such that the holding device <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> controls relative movement between the tinted shield <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. However, the detent could alternatively be mounted to the head portion such that the holding device would control the position of the tinted shield relative to the head portion (see, e.g., the holding device <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>). In such an embodiment, the wearer would push the lever outwardly rather than inwardly to raise the tinted shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the tinted shield control lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for rotation relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about a laterally-extending lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. However, it should be noted that the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> could alternatively pivot about the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Returning to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, an oblong hole <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> in the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> fits over a protrusion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that defines the tinted shield axis <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the lever is constrained by the hole <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and protrusion <highlight><bold>462</bold></highlight> to pivotal movement over a fixed, preferably acute arc. A resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> connects between the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to bias the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> into a neutral position that is part way between the extreme pivotal positions of the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> over the fixed arc. The resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> is illustrated as a bi-directional torsion spring, but could alternatively comprise any other type of resilient member such as a rubber/elastic band, a tension spring, a compression spring, a combination of several resilient members, etc. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> designed to be grasped by the wearer&apos;s gloved hand. The handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can be pulled downwardly to pivot the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> downwardly (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>) relative to the neutral position in a tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> lowering direction. Conversely, the handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> can be pushed upwardly to pivot the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> upwardly (clockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>), relative to the neutral position, in a tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> raising direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> includes a lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>. An inwardly-extending lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> formed on the inside of the left side <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) fits into the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Consequently, when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in the lowering direction, an upper edge <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> engages the lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> and pulls the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> downwardly (counterclockwise as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) into its lowered position. As discussed above, the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the holding device automatically lock the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> into the lowered position to prevent the tinted shield from moving upwardly under the force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the wearer releases the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and allows it to return to its neutral position under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> remains in its lowered position. The raising force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> prevents the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from pivoting downwardly further unless the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is again pushed downwardly to further lower the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> further includes a raising wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight>. The wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> is positioned on the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> such that when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in its raising direction, the wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> contacts the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of the holding device. Thereafter, a sloped surface of the wedge <highlight><bold>484</bold></highlight> slidingly engages the shallowly-sloped sides of the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, thereby forcing the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and the tooth-anchor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> laterally-outwardly until the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> disengage the teeth <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the teeth <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> disengage from each other, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> freely pivots upwardly into its raised position under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> of the lever is long enough in an annular direction relative to the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> that the edges of the hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> do not engage the lowering protrusion <highlight><bold>478</bold></highlight> when the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is moved in the raising direction. Alternatively, the entire lower side of the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> could be eliminated such that the lowering hole <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight> comprises just a lowering upper edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> bumper <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> is provided on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a position corresponding to an upper edge of the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position. The bumper <highlight><bold>486</bold></highlight> cushions the impact force of the upwardly-moving tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> when the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is thrust upwardly under the biasing force of the resilient member <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a protective eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> pivotally connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for pivotal movement relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> about the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The pivotal connection between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably includes frictional surfaces that discourage pivotal movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> will only pivot between its raised and lowered positions when pushed/pulled by the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 12</cross-reference>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> comprises a double-layer, semi-crescent-shaped clear shield that includes an outer, semi-spherical, semi-crescent shaped layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and an inner, semi-cylindrically shaped layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> curves from left to right as it progresses around the inside of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, tabs <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> extend inwardly from the inner side of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to hold the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> in place between the tabs <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The perimeter of the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> includes a ribbon <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of silicon that seals the two layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> together such that an air space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> is formed between the layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The air space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> forms a thermal barrier that discourages condensation on the inner side of the inner layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and the outer side of the outer layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to ensure that the wearer has a clear field of vision through the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. While a double-layer eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferred, the eye shield may alternatively comprise a single layer shield without departing from the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, the inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> could alternatively both be semi-spherically shaped or both be semi-cylindrically shaped, or both have asymmetrical shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 12</cross-reference>, a lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends downwardly away from the remainder of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in the direction of movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (i.e., generally perpendicularly to a radial direction of the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>). Consequently, when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is lowered into its lowered position, its lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>engages sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> disposed on the jaw shield <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create a tight seal that discourages cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a resilient material such as foam or rubber. The sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> preferably have a tubular cross-section that includes a longitudinally extending cut through which the lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is moved into its lower position. As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the sealing strips <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> are fastened to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within channels <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> that are formed in and extend around an upper perimeter of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The lower edge <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> extends into the channel <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> To further discourage cold air from entering the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is contoured to closely follow the contours of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. While not shown in this embodiment, a sealing strip may be provided on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to seal the small gap formed between the upper edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, while the tinted and eye shields <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> pivot about separate axes <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>, respectively, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be modified such that both shields <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> would pivot about the same axis without deviating from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the handle portion <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> of the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> extends downwardly enough that it is disposed below the lower edge of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> even when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is disposed behind the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (i.e., closer to the inner space <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and closer to the wearer) regardless of whether the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised or lowered positions. Consequently, the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be raised and lowered using the lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> even when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. The lever <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> therefore advantageously eliminates the need to raise the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in order to reposition the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> As best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the eye shield has upper and lower portions <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The lower portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is the portion that is disposed in front of the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position and is see-through or clear so that the wearer can see through the lowered eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is disposed above the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> regardless of the position of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position and the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position, the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is disposed in front of the tinted shield. In the illustrated embodiment, the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is see-through or clear so that the raised tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be inspected through the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> While the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is clear in the illustrated embodiment, it is also contemplated that the upper portion of the eye shield is opaque or tinted. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> illustrates an eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> that may replace the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without deviating from the scope of the present invention. Except as expressly stated herein, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is identical to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. A lower portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is clear to enable the wearer to see through the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight>. An upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is opaque. The opaque upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be created by applying a frosted or opaque layer to the inside of an otherwise see-through portion. For example, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> may be created by applying an opaque layer (spay paint, paint, etc.) to the interior side of the upper portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>. Although the opaque layer may alternatively be applied to the outside of the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the interior side is preferred so that the opaque layer is less exposed to wear and abrasion. Alternatively, the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may comprise a material such as plastic that is inherently opaque. In such an embodiment, the lower portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>would comprise distinct materials. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is mounted to the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position, and the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is in its raised position, the upper portion <highlight><bold>525</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>hides the tinted shield <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> from view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes an eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> that electrically heats the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to discourage water and frost from forming on the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and obstructing the wearer&apos;s view. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an outwardly looking side view of the inner right side of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. An electric heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight>, which preferably comprises a thin wire, extends within the space <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> defined between outer and inner layers <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. One end of the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a forward electrical contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> disposed on the inside surface of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> is disposed forwardly from and radially outwardly from the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight>. The forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> covers an arc, which has the axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> as its centerline. The other end of the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to a rearward electrical contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>, which is generally a mirror image of the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> relative to the axis <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight>. The forward and rearward contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> each comprise electrically-conductive laterally-inner surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the eye shield heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> further includes forward and rearward sets of electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> disposed forwardly and rearwardly, respectively, from the lever axis <highlight><bold>452</bold></highlight> on the right lateral side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to an external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> mounted on the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> is adapted to be connected via a power lead (not shown) to an electrical power source such as a snowmobile&apos;s battery system. When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a sealing ring <highlight><bold>562</bold></highlight> is sandwiched between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the inner surface of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to protect the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> from the outside environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> When the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is mounted to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> continuously, slidingly, electrically engages at least one of the forward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> throughout the pivotal range of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> relative to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the rearward contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> continuously, slidingly, electrically engages at least one of the rearward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> throughout the pivotal range of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the heating element <highlight><bold>532</bold></highlight> is continuously electrically connected to the external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> on the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the electrical connection between the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that is defined by the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the contact surfaces <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> could be positioned such that the forward contact surface <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight> only electrically engages one of the forward electrical contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> when the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position. The same may be true for the rearward contact surface <highlight><bold>542</bold></highlight> and the rearward contact points <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight>. Consequently, lowering the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> into the lowered position turns on the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> turns off the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Because the power supply lead is adapted to be attached to the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> instead of directly to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, as is known in conventional eye shield heating systems, the power supply lead cannot act as a tether and apply a raising or lowering force to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the power supply lead does not interfere with the wearer&apos;s operation of the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a mounting bracket <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for a flashlight or other type of external, removable gear. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flashlight <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> is mounted to the mounting bracket <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. The mounting bracket may include electrical contacts similar to the contact points <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> of the eye shield heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Such contacts would provide electrical power to the flashlight and be electrically connected to the external power supply jack <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Additional features may also be provided on the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, a rear light may be installed on the back side of the head portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lights are LEDs that are preferably connected to a vehicle power supply in the same manner as the heating system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> A communications system may also be installed in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that the wearer can communicate with the wearer of a second helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or second communications system. Such a communications system would be particularly advantageous for use by a driver and passenger of a snowmobile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> illustrate a helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Like the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. Also as in the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> included two fixed side portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and a detachable center portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> A separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> like the previously described separable hinge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> selectively connects the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> to the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. Inner sides <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> of the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> are generally planar, but may alternatively be curved, bumped, convex, concave, angled, etc. Accordingly, as viewed from the front, the inner sides <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> generally form a V shape (as opposed to the generally U shape of the inner sides <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and pin <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>). In use, this V-shaped opening generally forms a funnel that guides the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> into alignment with the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> when a wearer attempts to engage the separable pieces (e.g., a C-shaped clip and a pin) of the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> that is operatively connected to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> via a mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight>. The breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> and mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> are similar to the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a redundant detailed description of the similar or identical features and structures is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 14A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> includes a control knob assembly <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight> that differs from the control knob <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of the previously described mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The control knob assembly <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight> includes a control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> connected to a ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. As in the previous embodiment, the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> is mounted to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> for relative pivotal movement about a pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. However, the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> cannot move axially along the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> relative to the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>. The ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is connected to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in a gimbal fashion that allows the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to swivel relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> but ensures that the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> rotates with the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. To allow swiveling movement, the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> includes two pivot pins <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> that fit into slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> formed inside the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> allow the pivot pins <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight> to slide axially (along the axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>) to some extent and allow the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> to pivot relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> about their own axes. An inner circumferential surface of the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> includes threads <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> that mesh with the external threads of an outer axial member (not shown) that is functionally identical to the outer axial member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. The threads <highlight><bold>850</bold></highlight> define a second pivot axis <highlight><bold>855</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> when the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> is in a neutral position within the slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight> but forms an angle with the pivot axis <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> when the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> moves within the slots <highlight><bold>840</bold></highlight>. The gimbal connection between the control knob <highlight><bold>8000</bold></highlight> and the ring <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> allows the breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> to translate slightly up, down, left, and right relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, which allows the breathing mask <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> to be positioned in a greater variety of positions within the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> than the breathing mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the previously described embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 16</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes an eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> that is similar to the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> connects to the head portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> for relative pivotal movement about an eye shield pivot axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. The eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a heating system <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> that electrically heats the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to discourage water and frost from forming on the eye shield <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and obstructing the wearer&apos;s view. An electric heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight>, which preferably comprises a thin wire, extends within the space defined between outer and inner layers of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. A bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> is formed in one side of the head portion of the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The bore is aligned with the eye shield axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>. Electrically insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> extend inwardly into the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> through the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>. At least a small amount of slack in the insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is preferably provided within the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> to ensure that the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the pivotal operation of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Within the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, the insulated ends <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extend between a hard outer shell of the head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a soft internal cushion of the head portion <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to an electrical power supply jack mounted on the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. the electrical power supply jack is adapted to be removably electrically connected to an electrical power source such as a snowmobile&apos;s battery system. Because the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> extends through the bore <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight> at the axis <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not interfere with the pivotal movement of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, because the connection between the power supply and the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not require the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> to be disposed on an outside of the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, the heating element <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> does not get caught on objects outside the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> generally show the progressive detachment of the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> from the helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is attached to the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> and the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is lowered. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is then raised. While removing the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> of the illustrated helmet <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> requires the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to be at least partially raised, a helmet according to the present invention may alternatively be designed such that the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may be removed without raising the eye shield <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> latch mechanism like the latch mechanism <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the previous embodiment may be released to allow the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> to pivot outwardly away from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> about the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference>, the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may then be pivoted outwardly and downwardly away from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 21</cross-reference>, the separable hinge <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> may subsequently be completely separated to separate the detachable portion <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> from the fixed portions <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> illustrate a helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> according to an alternative embodiment of the present invention. To avoid redundant disclosure, an exhaustive description of the elements of the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> that are similar to or identical to the previously described embodiments is omitted. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> includes a head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, a breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight>, and a breathing mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> operatively connecting the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> is rigidly connected to (or integrally formed with) the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. However, the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, or a portion of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> may alternatively be movably connected to the head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, as is described above in connection with one or more of the previous embodiments. The head portion <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> together define an inner space <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The breathing mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> adjustably connects the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> so as to selectively move the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> within the inner space <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> (a) away from an interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> and toward the mouth and nose of the wearer, and (b) toward the interior surface of the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> and away from the mouth and nose of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, the mask adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> comprises a control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>, an axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>, and a retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> connects to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> for relatively free rotation relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> about an adjustment mechanism axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>). However, the connection between the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> prevents the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> from moving along the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> includes a central, internally-threaded bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> that is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> includes an externally threaded portion <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> that is threaded into the internally threaded bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> of the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> such that the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> is aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, an axially extending keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> is formed in the outer surface of the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight>. The retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> mounts to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. While the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> is bolted to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment, the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> and jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> may alternatively be connected in any other fashion (for example, integral formation, glue, screws, rivets). When the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> is threaded into the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> of the knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight>, the retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> engages the keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, which prevents the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. While a keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> and retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> are used in the illustrated embodiment to discourage the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating relative to the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, a variety of other structures may be used to accomplish this task without deviating from the scope of the present invention. For example, an accordion-folded connector such as the connector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and discussed above may be used. Moreover, the adjustment mechanism may alternatively rely on engagement between the wearer&apos;s face and the breathing mask to discourage the axial member from rotating relative to the wearer, the helmet, and the jaw shield about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> To adjust the adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight>, the helmet wearer rotates the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. The resulting relative rotation of the threads of the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> causes the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> and the attached breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to telescopically move along the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> relative to the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and the jaw shield <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>. The retaining key <highlight><bold>1280</bold></highlight> and keyway <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> ensure that rotation of the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> will cause telescopic movement of the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> by preventing the axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> from rotating with the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight>. The wearer can therefore use the control knob <highlight><bold>1260</bold></highlight> and adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>1240</bold></highlight> to snugly fit the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> against his/her mouth and nose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The axial member <highlight><bold>1270</bold></highlight> defines an axially extending opening <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> that fluidly connects the breathing space within the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Together, the bore <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> define an exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> that fluidly connects the breathing space within the breathing mask <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> to the ambient environment outside the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. The exhaust air passageway <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> is generally aligned with the axis <highlight><bold>1290</bold></highlight> and is positioned such that it extends downwardly and forwardly as it progresses away from the mouth and nose of the wearer when the wearer wears the helmet <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The foregoing illustrated embodiments are provided to illustrate the structural and functional principles of the present invention and are not intended to be limiting. To the contrary, the principles of the present invention are intended to encompass any and all changes, alterations and/or substitutions within the spirit and scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to protective garments and more particularly to a protective vest and head gear for use in hazardous activities, as for example, riding a motorcycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art and Objects </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For sometime, it has become commonplace for persons engaged in a hazardous activity to wear protective head gear. Motorcycle operators in many jurisdictions are required to wear a helmet and construction and factory workers are required to wear protective head gear frequently referred to as &ldquo;hard hats.&rdquo; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Absolute total protection for the entire body from all hazardous activities is not possible, at least in a manner that permits the wearer to perform the desired activity. However, what further protection can be achieved is highly desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Motorcycle operation is particularly hazardous as the operator is totally exposed except possible for a helmet and possible a leather jacket and leather pants. However, motorcycles are increasing popular, frequently being operated by professionals and business executives. Unfortunately, with motorcycle operation, there is ultimately a near certainty that an accident will occur. Some of those accidents will result in limited injury but serious injury is a realty of motorcycle operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The body torso contains vital organs most vulnerable to injury. The head is protected by a helmet but the torso of the body including the body, chest and abdomen can receive a hard impact resulting in serious injury and even death. Even with a helmet in place, the neck also can be seriously injured unless excessive movement of the head is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the Scaglione Patent, U. S. Pat. No. 6,253,389, a protective garment is described and claimed. The device, described in the patent works well to protect the wearer but a need still exists for a more user friendly device without compromising safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an object of this investigation to provide a protective garment to shield the torso from injury. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a protective garment that protects the neck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a protective garment including both a vest and helmet that can be easily worn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to provide a protective garment that is comparatively inexpensive to produce and of pleasant appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art as the description thereof proceeds. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A protective garment for the head neck and torso of the body of a person wearing the protective garment which includes a helmet and a vest which vest has a back section, a left front section and a right section. The helmet has a head section with a visor and a neck section and a front section which is partially coextensive with the neck section, the front section being capable of being opened. The left front section and the right front section are mounted to rotate on the back section to bring the left front section and the right front section together. The left front section has an upper left section which is rigid and a lower left front section which is flexible. The right front section has an upper right front section which is rigid and a lower right hand section which is flexible. A fastening means secures the left front section and the right front section together. The helmet has a lower edge and the vest has an upper edge. A means is provided at the lower edge of the helmet and at the upper edge of the vest to secure the helmet to the vest and to permit the helmet to rotate on the vest.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the protective garment includes a helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is similar to known helmets now worn by motorcycles operators and has a head section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which fits about the neck. The neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which is also the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is essentially circular. A visor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is located in the front of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the head section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to permit the obviously essential visibility and can be rotated open about pivots <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A feature of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is distinctive from helmets currently known, is a flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is a protrusion extending outwardly from the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> generally at right angles to the vertical axis <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as worn. The flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> also extends continuously about the entire lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and thus is essentially circular as is the lower edge <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Beneath the visor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and partially coextensive with the neck section <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is put on the head by opening the front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is hinged on the left side by a hinge (not shown). The front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then secured by a locking device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A vent <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is located in the front section <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to permit air to enter the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has three major sections, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, namely a back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and a left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has an upper left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A and a lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, has an upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> A and a lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B. The terms &ldquo;left&rdquo; and &ldquo;right&rdquo; are consistent with the left and right sides and arms of one wearing the protective garment. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are generally each a quarter of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and are both located on the front of the wearer to cover the chest and abdomen of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The upper left section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A is at the top of the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and is substantially smaller than the lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B. The upper left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A is made from a hard substance, as is the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> while the lower left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B is made of a material such as heavy duty leather which prevents abrasions and provides at least limited flexibility. Similarly, the upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A is at the top of the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and is substantially smaller than the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B. The upper left front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A is also made from a hard substance while the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B is also made from a material such as leather that is highly protective but flexible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The upper left section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A and the lower lleft front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>B join one another at a seam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>C. Similarly, the upper right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>A and the lower right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> B join one another at a seam <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> covers the back and represents approximately one-half of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has an upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> which is connected to the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> about the neck of the wearer and a lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which fits about the waist of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is formed as part of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is part of the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is circular when the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are secured to one another and the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> extends about all the way around the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> protrudes outside the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and has an internal surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> with an indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the internal surface <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. Within the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are partially recessed roller bearings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is horizontal and is adapted to receive the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, when in the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is permitted to glide on the roller bearings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this way, with the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> closed and with the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> completely encasing the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> readily rotates with the turning of the head of the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, when folded together, come in very close proximity to one another and are joined in the center of the front of the protective garment by a fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, preferably a slide fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> having two sets of interlocking teeth <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has a left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> has right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. When the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is closed, the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are in close proximity to one another and face one another. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is mounted on both the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> and has a upper end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a lower end <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In order to engage the fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> must be folded together with the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> facing one another as just explained. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> permits complete release between the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> when opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In both the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, toward the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, a semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed. In the back section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, two semicircular openings <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are formed, one of which matches the semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to form a left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the other semicircular opening <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the back section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> mates with the semicircular opening <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to form a right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are generally aligned with one another and are generally equally spaced from the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> extends from the right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends from the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the lower edge <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Both the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> form a slight overlap <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the upper edge <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Directly above the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, separate pins <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> join respectively the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and joins the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The left pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is aligned with the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> rotates on the left pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The right pin (not shown) is aligned with the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> rotates on the right pin (not shown) and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The left hinge <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the right hinge <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are preferably made a tough flexible material such as used in seatbelts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> of any suitable design is mounted on the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> across the left center edge <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and the right center edge <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> serves to assure that the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will not open on impact thus also assuring that the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will remain secured to the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> To wear the protective garment, the wearer places the vest <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> open and with the part of the left opening <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and right opening <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> held on the arms, the helmet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed on the head and the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is fitted into the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on the back section <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are then folded together with the flange <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> sliding into the indentation <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the collar <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the left front section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the right front section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and the lock <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are then both secured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, while a preferred embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects. The appended claims are therefore intended to cover all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to portable spas and, more particularly, to a spa which may be installed either in the ground or above the ground without hindering access to the technical equipment necessary for operation of the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, there have been two distinct types of spas, permanent in-ground spas and portable spas that can be installed either above or below the ground. In-ground spas consist essentially of a shell installed in the ground that includes hydro-jets around its perimeter designed to circulate heated water within the spa. Plumbing to the hydro-jets must be installed underground and routed to the spa from a remote maintenance area which houses the necessary technical equipment, such as the pumps, heaters, filters and valves. While in-ground spas are generally considered more aesthetically pleasing than portable spas, they are also relative expensive and time consuming to install and are virtually impossible to remove and subsequently install at a different location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Portable spas are usually stand-alone upright structures in which the water reservoir and all of the plumbing and technical equipment are within a single self-contained unit. These spas are advantageous in that they are easily installed above the ground without excavating the ground, and they can be moved to another location with little or no damage to the spa itself. Since portable spas are typically about three to four feet tall, a deck, or at least a set of stairs, is often built around the top of the spa to enhance the spa&apos;s appearance as well as provide easier accessibility for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In some cases, owners of portable spas will install the spa below ground level to simulate the appearance of a permanent in-ground spa. However, the current industry rules governing underground installation of portable spas requires excavation of a hole larger than the spa itself, and the construction of a retaining wall or other suitable barrier to keep the pressure of the surrounding earth off the side walls of the spa. This undesirably adds to the installation expense and requires construction of a deck or the like to cover the gap between the top of the spa and the retaining wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Portable spas have traditionally provided access to the technical equipment (i.e., pumps, heater, etc.) through an equipment access door in one of the side walls of the spa. If the spa is installed above the ground, with a deck built around the spa, the deck must include a door or hole in one side to reach the spa&apos;s equipment access door. This has the disadvantage that it detracts from the appearance of the deck while increasing the expense. It also may be inconvenient to maintain or repair the spa&apos;s equipment, since one must crawl under the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Similar disadvantages arise when a portable spa is installed below ground level. In these cases, the retaining wall in the excavated hole must be considerably wider than the spa itself to provide room to reach the spa&apos;s equipment access door at the side of the spa. Not only is the cover for this hole (in the deck between the spa and the retaining wall) usually unattractive, but the hole itself poses a potential safety hazard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has existed a definite need for a universal portable spa than can be installed either above the ground or below the ground, while simultaneously providing access to the technical equipment, and without sacrificing appearance and safety. There has also existed a need for a portable spa that is easier to install, repair and maintain. The present invention satisfies these needs and provides further related advantages. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a spa for use in heating and circulating water in the form of a self-contained unit having all of the equipment necessary for operation of the spa. The spa is capable of either above-ground installation in the manner of a portable spa or direct in-ground installation in the manner of a permanently installed spa. In either case, regardless of the manner of installation, access to the equipment for operation of the spa is convenient and not hindered in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The spa comprises a reservoir for holding water and an outer wall surrounding the reservoir. An equipment bay containing all of the equipment necessary for operation of the spa is located in and accessible from an opening of the top portion of the spa between the outer wall and the reservoir. A cover over the opening to the equipment bay is opened from the top portion of the spa to permit access to all of the equipment in the equipment bay. Thus, access to the equipment is provided in a safe and convenient fashion, free of any obstructions that may be around the outer wall at the side of the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, the opening to the equipment bay is provided in a substantially horizontal coping that joins the reservoir to the outer wall. When the cover is closed, it may be sealed to the opening in a substantially water-tight manner so that the equipment in the equipment bay, such as a heater, pump and related control equipment, can be free of water intrusion. The spa also includes a water filter in a filtration compartment normally flooded with water from the reservoir, and filter cartridges for filtering impurities from the water. The filtration compartment is normally separated from the equipment which may be housed in a separate equipment compartment, and the two compartments need not be covered by the same cover. However, for convenience, the two compartments may be located side-by-side and share a common cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, reinforcing means are provided between the outer wall and the reservoir for supporting the outer wall against deformation from external forces. When the spa is installed below ground level, the reinforcing means withstands the external forces from excavated ground that is in direct contact with, and therefore applies pressure directly against, the outer wall. The reinforcing means may comprise a plurality of internal support elements, it may comprise a dense foam material, or it may comprise a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the reinforcing means, the support elements comprise a framework including a plurality of horizontal bottom support elements, a plurality of horizontal top support elements, and a plurality of vertical support elements that connect the bottom support elements to the top support elements. A plurality of bracing elements connected at an angle between the vertical support elements and the horizontal bottom support elements assist in supporting the framework and, thus, the outer wall against deformation from lateral external forces. This framework may be comprised of pressure-treated wood or other suitable materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In an alternative form of the invention, the opening to the equipment bay may be provided in the outer wall at a side of the spa. A shield is provided over the opening that can, like the reinforcing means, withstand deformation from external forces, for example, from the ground surrounding the spa. The shield is spaced from the opening such that the spa can be installed below ground level, and the equipment bay can be accessed by removing the cover over the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The spa of the present invention is extremely versatile, as it can be installed either above ground or below ground level, while still providing a means to access the equipment necessary to operate the spa. Access to the equipment is both convenient and safe, and the overall appearance of the spa and its surrounding environment can be made to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For example, if the spa is installed above the ground, a wood deck may be constructed around the spa, without requiring a side access door or a top access door in the deck, since access to the equipment bay can be reached from the top of the spa. Similarly, the spa can be installed directly in the ground and the excavated earth can be applied directly to the side of the spa, to simulate the appearance of a permanent in-ground spa. No retaining walls or other type of barriers are needed. Thus, the resulting spa has enhanced utility, as it may be portable or permanently installed at the option of the user. It is also relatively easy and inexpensive to install, repair and maintain, without any underground pipes and attendant problems from leaks or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the invention, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

The spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of either above-ground installation, in which a raised deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be constructed around the spa, or direct in-ground installation, in which the spa is installed in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with the earth directly in contact with the side of the spa. In either case, access to the equipment required for service of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is convenient and not hindered in any way by the manner of installation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> installed directly in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. However, whether the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed in the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, or above the ground, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the basic structure of the spa is still the same. It is defined by a shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which may be constructed of fiberglass, acrylic, high-impact thermoplastic materials, or any other suitable lightweight, high-strength material not easily susceptible to damage from water or sunlight. The shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be molded in a single unit, but more commonly it is a combination of several pieces joined together by adhesives or fasteners or by similar methods known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises an outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that defines the outer shape of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and functions as a housing to enclose all of the remaining elements of the spa. In particular, the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a vertical side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a horizontal bottom wall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A horizontal coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along the upper surface of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a smooth transition from the vertical side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to an internal water reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> designed to hold a quantity of water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and at least one person <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is preferably filled with a stiff insulating material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, such as a dense Styrofoam or the like. The insulating material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> increases the structural integrity of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as well as its insulating qualities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is included in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for the user&apos;s ease and safety while entering the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and bench seats <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are included for the user to sit or lounge in the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A foot well <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also typically included in the center of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Multiple hydro-jets (not shown) located around the perimeter of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provide powerful streams of heated water that vigorously circulate the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the reservoir. It will be understood that the arrangement of the step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, seats <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, foot well <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (and hydro-jets) illustrated in the drawings is but one possible configuration, and many other arrangements could be used. In addition, in cases where the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed above the ground <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an optional drainage line (not shown) originating at the lowest point of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and terminating outside of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be included to assist in draining of the reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is considerably wider at one side of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> than any other. The coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is enlarged in this area to provide an opening <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> leading to an equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has two sections comprising an equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, both of which are located between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the internal reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in close proximity such that a single cover may be used to cover both. However, it is not a necessary requirement of this invention that the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> be located next to each other or that they share a common cover. Thus, a cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are shown. For convenience, both of these covers will be referred to as the cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes a skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that provides a water flow path from the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Thus, the water level in the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is maintained essentially at the same level as that in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the lower edge of the skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is just below the water level so that only water from the uppermost surface of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can enter the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The skimmer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also preferably includes an inwardly hinged skimmer door <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or the like that allows water and floating debris from the upper surface of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to enter filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In the event that a wave or backflow causes water from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to flow back into the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the skimmer door <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will be forced to close. Thus, floating debris that enters the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> will remain trapped therein until the user removes it during a periodic cleaning. A filter cartridge <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located near the bottom of the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> serves to filter impurities in the water before it travels from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through a pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and on to the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The filter cartridges <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are removable so that they can be periodically cleaned or replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Unlike the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is not flooded with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. It is isolated from the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a vertical wall <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> houses a conventional water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (or pumps as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), such as a motor-driven impeller-type water pump. It also houses a conventional water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> for heating the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and maintaining a desired water temperature within the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A control box <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> houses the necessary controls for controlling operation of the water pumps <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and any other necessary equipment. A sump pump <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is located in the lower-most portion of the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and serves to remove any excess water that might leak or be splashed into the compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or, when installed in-ground, any water resulting from fluctuation in water table levels. Power to operate the water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is supplied from an external electrical source (not shown) through a conventional hookup that may be located just below the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The water pump <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> draws water from the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and into the water heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> through an intake pipe <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. After passing through the heater <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is returned to the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by an output pipe <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that distributes the heated water to the one or more hydro-jets located in various positions around the sides of the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The intake and output pipes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are preferably constructed of polyvinylchloride, but could also be made of other lightweight, noncorrosive materials. If it is desired to create a low-maintenance water treatment in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, a feature traditionally associated with spas of this type, the output pipe <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> may also include an ozone generator (not shown) that mixes ozone gas with the water flow before it enters the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be installed above ground level, in the manner of a portable spa or, alternatively, it may be installed below ground level, in the manner of a permanently installed in-ground spa. If above-ground installation is desired, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, one simply needs to place the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a firm and level area (such as on a concrete pad or hard-packed earth), fill the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and connect the power source. Since the side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa are typically several feet high, an elevated deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may also be built around the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to improve accessibility and appearance. Many variations of decks will serve this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Importantly, the elevated deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does not require an equipment access door, either in the side or on the top of the deck, in order to gain access to the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. This is because all of the equipment in the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can be conveniently reached by removing the cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at the top of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Hence, unsightly and potentially unsafe access doors in the deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are avoided, as is the extra expense to make them. Moreover, the ease with which the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can be reached is substantially enhanced. This is no need to crawl under the deck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through a side access door, or down through an access door in the top of the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to be installed below ground level, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a hole just slightly larger than the spa must be excavated. Once the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is placed in the hole, which may be as deep as the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, some of the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that was excavated may be replaced directly around the walls of the spa, thus locking the spa into place. The reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can then be filled with water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the power source can be connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Importantly, no retaining wall or other type of barrier needs to be installed to keep the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> away from the side walls <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, since the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a self-contained unit having all of the necessary equipment to operate the spa, there is no need for additional excavation for plumbing, such as output pipes or hydro-jets. Again, only the power source needs to be connected, and since it is located just below the edge of the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, it also does not require additional excavation. Thus, the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be easily installed in areas where space is limited, and it may be installed in virtually any orientation desired by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even though the entire side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is buried underground, access to the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is easily and conveniently accomplished through the top access cover <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the coping <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Consequently, there is no need to build a retaining wall or the like around the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> before it is placed in the hole. However, if the appearance of an in-ground spa is desired, and the user wishes to keep the option to move the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the future, such a conventional retaining wall could be built. Advantageously, since the equipment bay <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is accessible at the tope of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, only a small clearance is necessary between the spa side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the retaining wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed above-ground level, there will be some lateral forces against the walls comprising the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. For example, the weight of the water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> creates an outward lateral pressure against the reservoir walls and contributes to the overall weight of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and thus the forces exerted on the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> supporting the spa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Even more significant, however, is the lateral pressure against the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> caused by the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> when the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed directly in the ground. If the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is empty for a significant time, this lateral inward pressure could cause substantial damage or buckling of the walls without a counteracting support system. Accordingly, the present invention provides a reinforcing means to prevent this damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a reinforcing means comprising an internal support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> which provides the necessary structural support to enable the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to resist the subjacent lateral forces of the earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> resulting from in-ground installation. The support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of supports such as pressure treated wood. Other suitable supports, such as supports made from rigid plastic material, also can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is located in the space <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and comprises bottom horizontal supports <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, top horizontal supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and vertical supports <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending between and connecting the top supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the bottom supports <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Triangulation of the vertical supports <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is accomplished by braces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> having one end connected either to a vertical support <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or a top horizontal support <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and having another end connected to a corresponding horizontal bottom support <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> A dense foam or similar lightweight, high-strength material <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, discussed above, may also be used as a filler between the outer wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reservoir <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to increase the structural integrity as well as the insulation capacity of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, it is contemplated that an appropriate filler <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with the requisite structural strength and other characteristics could be used alone to support the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, without requiring the support framework <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> An alternative embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the equipment compartment <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the filtration compartment <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are accessible from the side of the shell <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a side access door <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. A side shield <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> isolates and protects the side access door <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> from the surrounding earth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for an in-ground installation. However, the excavated ground otherwise completely surrounds and abuts against the side wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as in the in-ground installation discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that the present invention provides a universal self-contained spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that can be installed either above ground or below ground level, while still providing a means to access the equipment necessary to service the spa. Access to the equipment is both convenient and safe, and the overall appearance of the spa <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its surrounding environment is as aesthetically pleasing as possible. The resulting spa is extremely versatile, as it may be portable or permanently installed at the option of the owner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> While a particular form of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the invention be limited, except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to collapsible furniture, and more particularly to bedding which may be used for temporary purposes such as for overnight guests. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Temporary beds have been used for many years and come in many forms, from a simple futon or air mattress to more complex &ldquo;hide-a-bed&rdquo; style devices. Such temporary beds are most often used when guests, either expected or otherwise, stay overnight. In such cases, it is desirable that the temporary bed be quick and easy to assemble, comfortable, and collapse to a small configuration which can be easily and conveniently stored in a closet or storage cabinet. An air mattress has the advantage of deflating to a very compact size when the internal air pressure is released, and can be set up in a relatively short amount of time. The air pressure in the mattress gives good support to body members and the air can redistribute within the mattress slightly in response to greater weight loads in certain areas. It can thus conform to the user&apos;s body, is lightweight, and is generally easily portable, even when inflated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Additionally, those who go camping out of trailers, etc. may wish to sleep out-of-doors, but may wish to isolate themselves from insects, snakes and other forest denizens which may roam the forest floor. For such purposes, an elevated bed, which is easily collapsible and portable, may be very useful. It also may be useful in rocky terrain, or in areas of thorns or burrs, which would otherwise contact the air mattress and possibly puncture it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the less effort involved in constructing the bed, the more desirable the typical user would consider the bed to be. People who are contemplating retiring to bed are often already in a state of fatigue or unsteadiness in which the construction of a bed from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration may seem a daunting prospect. Therefore, a bed structure which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting, would be very desirable in a variety of situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed which is elevated from contact with the ground or floor, and which is both very portable and comfortable for the user. There is also a need for a bed which requires minimal involvement by the user in its construction, or, even better, is largely self-erecting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There have been many variations adjustable beds which are designed so that the bed or a portion of it can incline. Such an inclining bed allows the user, who may be bed-ridden, or merely relaxing, to assume a sitting position for reading, watching television, etc. Inclining beds have been used in hospitals for many years, and are the subject of numerous U.S. patents, including U.S. Pat. No. 5,870,784, U.S. Pat. No. 5,105,486, U.S. Pat. No. 4,774,732, U.S. Pat. No. 4,025,972, U.S. Pat. No. 3,974,530, U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,393, U.S. Pat. No. 3,644,946, U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,528, U.S. Pat. No. 6,276,011 and others. These beds are generally bulky and often included motor-powered apparatus to achieve the inclination. There have a been a few attempts to use air pressure to change the inclination of the mattress, such as are found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,522, U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,731 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,044. These beds too are generally bulky and designed for stationary use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Collapsible beds are increasingly popular with the public as a way of providing easy and elegant bedding for visitors or for those with limited floor-space who appreciate having a bed that can be removed from use when not needed. Air-mattress beds are a convenient variation on this, as the volume of the bed is easily reduced merely by venting the internal air. However, as discussed above, air mattresses which are pitched on the floor of a dwelling, may be perceived as being less gracious than beds which are elevated from the floor. Elevated beds may have less intimate contact with floor dirt and grime, thus be more suitable for those with allergies or aversions to dirt. Furthermore, an elevated bed may be easier to get into and out of for those who may have trouble squatting on the floor, or for those with stiff joints or arthritis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For these reasons, it is desirable to have a frame which is collapsible under a mattress which is also preferably collapsible. However, applicant is unaware of any mechanism which allows the bed or frame of a collapsible frame to incline. Thus, a user of this style bed would need to position the bed adjacent to a wall and brace the feet from sliding in order to be able to sit up in bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Thus there is a need for a collapsible bed and bed frame which can incline to allow comfortable sitting by the user. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a collapsible bed which collapses to a compact configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a bed which inclines to allow the user to sit at an upright angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> And another object of the invention is to provide an inclining bed frame which can be used with a variety of mattresses. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the present invention is an air bed with a support structure. As illustrated in the various drawings herein, and particularly in the view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> form of this preferred embodiment of the inventive device is depicted by the general reference character <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrates an air bed with an elevated support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, having generally an air bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (not visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes generally a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having an entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is sealed with a closure fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but which is also possibly any conventional device such as Velcro, hook-and-eye fasteners, etc. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be plastic, cloth, leather, etc. and encloses at least a portion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, either before or after inflation. The zipper <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is then closed to complete the installation of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be removed as desired through the same entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, again, either before or after the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is deflated. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a number of cells <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and at least one inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through which air is introduced to inflate the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> need not completely enclose the entire air mattress, but may enclose only a portion or portions such as the ends or sides of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 21</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> shows the articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are joined at the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> This configuration will be spoken of as &ldquo;expanding outwardly from a central area&rdquo;, although it is to be understood that one of the feet may actually remain in fixed position, while the remainder of the feet move outward. In other words, the central reference area from which the feet move, may itself move laterally. One example of this occurs when the collapsed support frame is placed in the corner of a room, where, say, the left rear foot of the frame is in the left rear corner of the room, and thus is constrained from movement in a further leftward or rearward direction. When the frame expands, all the other, non-constrained feet will expand outwardly from a central area to the right, or forward, or both, even as the central area itself will move to the right and forward, relative to the immobile left rear foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should also be understood that all the lines of direction of the movement of the feet are not expected to intersect at a precise point. The central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is thus a relatively small region from which the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> move outwardly, but there should be no inference that all feet must move in a specific lines, such as radially from a single specific center point. To one skilled in the art, it will be apparent that if such precise directionality were attempted, manufacturing errors would inevitably introduce variations. Thus, the expansion is considered to move outwardly from a central area or region, and should not be construed to imply any particular lines of direction, other than generally outward from this central area. The direction arrows and central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> below, are therefore not provided to show specific lines of movement which must be followed, but merely a general direction of movement towards, or away from, a general central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The articulated frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also optionally includes support webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which may have hooks (not shown) which anchor the support webbing to the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and/or the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and may also have attachment points (not shown) for securing the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the webbing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and thus to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show closer views of the assembled air bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which several of the pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are selected for detail views in detail circles A-F. The pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in this embodiment are made to receive 4 connections and thus will be called four-pivot connectors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. These are preferably reversible, so that the same four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be used as a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and as an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thus making for uniformity, and ease of manufacturing. The frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> too are preferably interchangeable and of uniform length, with the exception of the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, which are positioned in each of the four corners. These are composed of two or more corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may slide within each other in order to extend or contract in length. This is desirable because when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in collapsed position, the corner uprights <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be of greater length than when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is expanded. In the expanded position therefore, one of the corner members will preferably slide within the other, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 10</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>

Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle D of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and its included corner member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle E of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, corner upright <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and its included corner members <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a type of four-pivot connector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is seen in detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are also shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, thus the assembly sequence allows for the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to be placed upright, expanded, the fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inserted into the entry mouth <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the fastener <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closed, and the bed is ready to receive bed clothes, or be otherwise used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A useful variation on this invention is an air-bed with a self-expanding support structure. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> as element <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The structure and elements are much the same, and when elements correspond to those used previously, the same element numbers will be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The air-bed <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is attached to a support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, either directly, or preferably through a bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The attachment may be permanent or removable, by such conventional means as buttons, snaps, Velcro&reg;, etc., but it is important that the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as it expands, is attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, so that the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is urged to move with the expansion of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as discussed below. There is a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described previously, which may also be the bag enclosure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which protects the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from damage at points where it is rubbed against the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while inflating or deflating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> An air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is connected to an inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is electrically operated, and can be powered either by wall current or by batteries. If batteries are used, they may be included in a battery pack (not shown). The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably includes a sensor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which can be operated by a beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means from a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> or communicating means is preferably cordless, such as radio or infra-red diode laser beam, etc. The remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably has an on-off button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which activates and deactivates the electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is by no means a necessity, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will preferably have a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for back-up operation if the remote <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is misplaced or the remote&apos;s batteries are low, or if the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed not to be operated by remote control at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the direction arrows <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or it may be removable in order to allow access to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by either a hand pump or by mouth in case electrical power is unavailable for the electrical pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or if it breaks down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an isometric view of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which has been attached to the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a detail view of the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from which the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has been removed. Referring to both <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference>, the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably has a recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> into which the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been seated. This recess area <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to fit smoothly without extending far beyond the perimeter of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus protecting it from being bumped or knocked away from its position at the inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be maintained in position after the inflation is complete. Of course, the use of a recess area is optional and should not be considered as a limitation. Also, the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be made to be routinely removed after operation. In this case a self-sealing valve (not shown) is provided for the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is also shown, which is preferably included even when the pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is expected to be operated by remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature is a secondary inflation port <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may be used for attachment of a manual air pump or for inflation by lung power. This may be a conventional air valve as generally used in air mattresses. It may also be used as a venting port <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for allowing air pressure out of the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> if the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is to be maintained in position, perhaps permanently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of this invention uses an air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which is removable. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and inflation port <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably fitting with a friction lock (not visible) similar to those used to attach lens to cameras, and which forms an airtight seal between the two parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also preferably contains a pressure sensor or self-regulator (not visible) which detects or acts when the air pressure in the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has reached a predetermined level, and which then shuts off the air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This is also not a required feature and should not be construed as a limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the electrical air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be operated from batteries, perhaps from a battery pack. The bed <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is thus usable in the outdoors or in a cabin which is not equipped with power lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> This style of frame structure, which is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has many advantages, as it is constructed of a number of cross-members which are attached to each other at pivots, some of which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members, and some of which are included in pivot assemblies in the feet and upper connector assemblies. As discussed above, these pivot assemblies and pivots connect all the frame members to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. The frame can be thought of as an extended scissors-frame assembly since the tops and bottoms of each pair of frame members scissor together or apart. These scissor pairs are then joined in an extended assembly where the ends of multiple pairs are joined at the pivot assemblies. They also allow the frame as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. However, applicant is unaware of any mechanism which allows the bed or frame of a collapsible frame to incline. Thus, a user of this style bed would need to position the bed adjacent to a wall and brace the feet from sliding in order to be able to sit up in bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> An additional embodiment has been designed to address this problem by allowing a portion of the frame to incline. This embodiment of the present invention is an inclining collapsible bed, which is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and will be designated by the reference number <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Where elements are similar to those described with reference to the first embodiment, the same reference numbers will be used. Elements which are peculiar to this additional embodiment will generally be referred to by a three digit reference number prefaced by a &ldquo;2&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a front perspective view of the present inclining bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> with the bed in fully reclining position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows a front perspective view of the bed in inclining position <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> is shown in a close-up view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. The angle-retention mechanism <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> and also in an exploded view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the support frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> supports a mattress <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which can be an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but may also be any number of conventional mattresses or futons, as long as they are flexible or have a hinge in the region where the angle of incline begins. The frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is again preferably composed of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are configured in scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which are in turn configured in an extended scissor frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, as described above. The frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes an inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> which includes inclining support members <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, preferably telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, having an inner pole <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and an outer pole <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> especially), and an angle retention mechanism <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a clamp or adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Three adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are shown in the figure, preferably one for each line of frame members included. The end-most scissor pair <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the extended scissor frame assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> has a upward angled member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> which connects to the upper connector assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at the head-end corner of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and an downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, which connects to the corner foot <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. For this discussion, upward and downward angled are taken with respect to the foot of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> moving towards the head of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The upward and downward angled members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be identical to the other scissor pairs <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with the exception of having a pivot hole for connection of the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and having retention notches, to be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the upward angled members <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> by pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and downward angled members <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> pass through holes in the adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown especially in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, as the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is inclined, the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> pivots at its attachment with the upward angled member <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. As it does so, the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> moves upward and towards the rear of the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and also moves upward on the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows the detail circle F of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> in closer detail, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</cross-reference> show the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> in perspective and exploded views respectively. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the adjustable clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> includes a housing cavity <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, housing groove <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and housing through-hole <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, through which downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> passes and is allowed to slide unless stopped by a retention notch <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. A release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> having an end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, is pivotally attached to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is biased by spring <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> to engage the retention notches <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> until forced away from engagement by pressing on the end <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> of the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is attached to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> by a pivot <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which passes through the bracket pivot hole <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a set of bracket through-holes <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> through which the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> passes. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is allowed to slide freely along the telescoping pole <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and the angle of the pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> relative to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> is also allowed to rotate freely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> first retention notch <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> and a second retention notch <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> are shown. When the frame is in reclining position <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> may engage the first retention hole <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in order to give the bed stability in its reclining position. To incline the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is released by pressing the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. The adjuster clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is then free to slide along the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and telescoping member <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> as the inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> of the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> raises. The pivotal bracket <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is allowed to pivot relative to the adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> as the adjuster clip <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> moves. The adjuster housing <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> moves along the downward angled member <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> until the tip of the pin <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> reaches the second retention notch <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, which the spring <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> again engages to maintain the frame in an inclined angle until released by the release lever <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The mattress <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> will preferably have a fabric covering <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, to which portions of the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are attached, including the ends of the inner poles <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> so that they are drawn to telescope outward when the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is inclined, and are pushed back inward when the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is to be reclined. This fabric covering <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and its attachment to portions of various frame members also allow the frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to be self-expanding in response to inflation of an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as described above in reference to the previous embodiments. Also as described above, an air-pump, which may be remote controlled, may be used to inflate the air mattress, and a pressure-sensing valve may be used to turn off the pump when the appropriate pressure is reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Although two retention notches are shown in the preferred embodiment, it will be obvious to one skilled in the art that there could be more than two retention notches to allow intermediate angles of inclination between an upright position and reclining position. It is also possible that the fully reclining position can be maintained by allowing the mattress to lie on the upper connector assemblies so that a retention notch is not required, thus there may only a single retention notch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> It will also be obvious to one skilled in the art that many variations in the angle retention mechanism or adjustable clip mechanism are possible. As only one possible variation, instead of retention notches and pins, the angle of inclination can be established by the turning of a screw or wing nut, which compresses halves of a split-housing on the frame members., It is also possible that the clamp mechanism might be applied to the outer poles <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> of the telescoping poles <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>. The adjustable clips <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> are shown being applied to three parallel frame members. It is of course possible that the frame, and the bed supported by it, be of different widths than that shown by the figures, and may use greater or fewer parallel frame members, so that there may be two parallel rows, or four or more rows, used in single width beds or king-sized beds respectively. Of three or four parallel rows, clips or clamps may be applied to fewer than all parallel rows, such as only the outer rows, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not, limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of a preferred embodiment should not be limited by any of the above described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the following claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> present an easy and attractive way of providing bedding for overnight guests or visitors. The articulated support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which includes a number of frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which are attached to each other at pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which are positioned at the midpoints of the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and at pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and upper connector assemblies <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These pivot assemblies <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connect all the frame members <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other, so there are no loose pieces to be gathered and assembled. They also allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as a whole to be collapsed or expanded in a very easy and efficient manner. Force directed at any one of the corners causes movement in all the other corners, so that there is movement of the whole frame in either an inward or outward direction, relative to a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The pivots <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allow the frame structure <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move towards a central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from all sides as a unit when the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to be collapsed, and to move away from this central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> when expanding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In operation, the bed <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will be assumed to start in a collapsed configuration <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is squeezed together and is generally surrounded by the support frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> previously having been drawn together towards the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, discussed above. The air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at multiple points, either directly, or by being at least partially enclosed by a fabric covering <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is, in turn, attached at multiple points to the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is set upon its feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and inflated, either by the user&apos;s lung power or by activation of an electric pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. If the preferred air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is used, it is activated, either by operation of a manual on-off switch, or by pressing the button <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> on a remote control <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The air pump <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> begins filling the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which then begins to expand generally out from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As the mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands it presses laterally on the members of the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which pushes them also in the direction away from the central area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The feet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be optionally fitted with low friction pads which can thus slide across floor surfaces, or may also be fitted with wheels to allow the frame <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to expand easily and without hindrance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an inclining portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> by which the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be elevated to allow the user to sit up in bed. Such an inclining bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allows the user, who may be bed-ridden, or merely relaxing, to assume a sitting position for reading, watching television, etc. This provides many advantages for dwellers in small apartments or otherwise limited floor space so that the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may serve as a lounger or a sort of sofa when desired, while still allowing the bed to be folded to a compact bundle for storage. As with the other embodiments, the bed <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include an air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can be attached to the bed frame <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at multiple points and thus expand it automatically as the air mattress <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> expands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The present invention <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will find much application in user&apos;s homes, in commercial travel lodges, such as hotels, etc. where an extra bed may be needed, and may also find use in business offices to replace the occasional folding cot presently used by workaholics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For the above, and other, reasons, it is expected that the air bed with elevated and self-expanding support structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention will have widespread industrial applicability. Therefore, it is expected that the commercial utility of the present invention will be extensive and long lasting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to bed siderails, and, more particularly, to bed siderails with flexible portions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds often have siderails to reduce the likelihood that convalescing patients will inadvertently fall out of their beds. The siderails are usually constructed from metal or a similarly rigid material such as a stiff plastic or polymer, and may be raised and lowered vertically to accommodate a patient moving into and out of the hospital bed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hospital beds also often have a head section of the bed that may be pivoted upwardly about a transverse pivot axis to allow the patient to move to a sitting position. It is desirable to simultaneously pivot the siderails adjacent to the head section of the bed upwardly with the head section of the bed. To accommodate raising the siderails in this manner, the siderails are typically divided into two sections, a head section and a body section. The head section and body section siderails must be spaced apart at the transverse pivot axis to allow the head section siderail to pivot without impinging the stationary body section siderail. Therefore, a gap is created between the head section siderail and the body section siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a bed siderail of unitary construction which eliminates the gap between conventional siderails. The bed siderail of the present invention includes a flexible portion to allow a portion of the siderail adjacent the head section of the bed to pivot upwardly with the head section of the bed, while body section of the siderail remains substantially stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed having a frame and a head deck section coupled to the frame. The head deck section is movable relative to the frame from a generally horizontal position to an elevated position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the head deck section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its elevated position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, the flexible member bends in a second direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the head deck section is in its generally horizontal position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, a lifting mechanism is coupled to the frame and to the second end portion of the flexible member. The lifting mechanism is configured to raise and lower the flexible member relative to the frame. A locking mechanism is illustratively coupled to the lifting mechanism and a release handle coupled to the locking mechanism. Actuation of the release handle releases the locking mechanism and permits movement of the lifting mechanism and the flexible member relative to the frame. The illustrated embodiment also includes an extendible section located along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member and capable of extending and retracting along the longitudinal axis of the flexible member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Also according to the present invention, a siderail is provided for a bed including a patient support surface having opposite first and second sides, a head end, and a foot end spaced apart from the head end to define a length dimension of the patient support surface therebetween. The siderail includes first and second elongated flexible members coupled to the bed and extending along the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second flexible members illustratively extend for at least fifty percent of the length dimension of the patient support surface. The siderail also includes first and second lifting mechanisms coupled to the bed adjacent the first and second sides, respectively. The first and second lifting mechanisms also are coupled to the first and second flexible members, respectively, to raise and lower the first and second flexible members relative to the patient support surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another illustrated embodiment of the invention includes a siderail for a bed having a frame and an elevating section coupled to the frame, the elevating section having a raised position and a lowered position. The siderail includes an elongated flexible member having a longitudinal axis, a first end portion, and a second end portion. The first end portion is coupled to the elevating section so that the flexible member bends in a first direction relative to its longitudinal axis when the elevating section is in its raised position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another illustrative embodiment of the invention includes a siderail covering for a bed siderail having flexible portions and extendible portions. The siderail covering includes a material configured to flex along the flexible portion of the bed siderail and compress along the extendible portion of the bed siderail. The material including a plurality of compressible regions, and defines an central aperture configured to receive the bed siderail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Also according to the invention, the siderail covering material further defines a seam extending from the outer surface of the siderail cover to the central aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Additional features of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of the illustrated embodiment exemplifying the best mode of carrying out the invention as presently perceived.</paragraph>
